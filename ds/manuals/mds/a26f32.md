To reduce the risk of wire breakage, overheating, smoke, or fire, properly secure the cables in place and provide adequate slack in the cables so as not to stress the terminals.

To reduce the risk of injury or electric shock, switch off the main power before performing electrical work.

All electric work must be performed by a qualified electrician according to the local regulations, standards, and the instructions detailed in the Installation Manual. Capacity shortage to the power supply circuit or improper installation may result in malfunction, electric shock, smoke, or fire.

To reduce the risk of electric shock, smoke, or fire, install an earth leakage breaker on the power supply to each unit.

To reduce the risk of electric shock, smoke, or fire, install an inverter circuit breaker on the power supply to each unit. (Applicable to inverter units only)

Use properly rated breakers and fuses (earth leakage breaker, local switch <switch + fuse>, no-fuse breaker). The use of a breaker with a breaking capacity greater than the specified capacity may cause electric shock, malfunctions, smoke, or fire.

To reduce the risk of current leakage, wire breakage, smoke, or fire, keep the wiring out of contact with the refrigerant pipes and other parts, especially sharp edges.

[6]Relocation and Repairs

## Relocation and Repairs

To reduce the risk of refrigerant leakage, water leakage, injury, electric shock, and fire, units should only be moved or repaired by your dealer or qualified personnel.

To reduce the risk of wire shorting, electric shock, malfunctions, or fire, keep circuit boards dust free, and do not touch them with your hands or tools.

[7] AdditionalPrecautions

## Additional Precautions

To avoid damage to the unit, use appropriate tools to install, inspect, or repair the unit.

Use properly rated breakers and fuses (inverter circuit breaker, local switch <switch + fuse>, no-fuse breaker). The use of a breaker with a breaking capacity greater than the specified capacity may cause electric shock, malfunctions, smoke, or fire. (Applicable to inverter units only)

To reduce the risk of current leakage, overheating, smoke, or fire, use properly rated cables with adequate current carrying capacity.

Proper grounding must be provided by a licensed electrician.

Do not connect the grounding wire to a gas pipe, water pipe, lightning rod, or telephone wire. Improper grounding may result in electric shock, smoke, fire, or malfunction due to electrical noise interference.

To reduce the risk of wire shorting, electric leak, electric shock, smoke, or fire, do not perform maintenance work in the rain.

To reduce the risk of injury, electric shock, and fire, properly reinstall all removed components after completing repair work.

To reduce the risk of refrigerant and water leakage, check the pipe supports and insulation for damage during inspection or repair, and replace or repair the ones that are found to be deteriorated.

To reduce the risk or malfunction, turn on the power at least 12 hours before starting operation, and leave the power turned on throughout the operating season.

Recover all refrigerant in the units, and dispose of it properly according to any applicable laws and regulations.

To reduce the risk of deterioration of refrigerant oil and compressor malfunctions caused by a refrigerant that contains chloride, such as R22, only use R410A.

Provide a maintenance access to allow for the inspection of pipes above the ceiling or the buried pipes.

Take appropriate measures against electrical noise interference when installing the air conditioners in hospitals or facilities with radio communication capabilities. Inverter, high-frequency medical, or wireless communication equipment as well as power generators may cause the air conditioning system to malfunction. Air conditioning system may also adversely affect the operation of these types of equipment by creating electrical noise.

To reduce the risk of damage to the unit, leave the valves on the unit closed until refrigerant charging is completed.

Place a wet towel on the refrigerant service valve before brazing the pipes to keep its temperature from rising above 120ºC and damaging the surrounding equipment.

Direct the blazing torch flame away from the adjacent cables and sheet metal to keep them from being overheated and damaged.

Prepare tools for exclusive use with R410A. Do not use the following tools if they have been used with the conventional refrigerant (R22): gauge manifold, charging hose, refrigerant leak detector, check valve, refrigerant charge spout, vacuum gauge, and refrigerant recovery equipment. R410A does not contain chloride, so leak detectors for use with older types of refrigerants will not detect an R410A leak. Infiltration of the residual refrigerant, refrigerant oil, or water on these tools may cause the refrigerant oil in the new system to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

To reduce the risk of the vacuum pump oil backflowing into the refrigerant cycle and causing the refrigerant oil to deteriorate, use a vacuum pump with a check valve.

Have a set of tools for exclusive use with R410A. Consult your nearest Mitsubishi Electric Dealer.

Keep dust, dirt, and water off charging hose and flare tool. Infiltration of dust, dirt, or water into the refrigerant circuit may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

Use refrigerant piping and couplings that meet the applicable standards. For refrigerant pipes, use pipes made of phosphorus deoxidized copper. Keep the inner and outer surfaces of pipes and couplings clean and free of such contaminants as sulfur, oxides, dust, dirt, shaving particles, oil, and moisture. Failure to follow these directions may result in the deterioration of refrigerant oil or compressor damage.

Store the piping materials indoors, and keep both ends of the pipes sealed until immediately before brazing. Keep elbows and other joints in plastic bags. Infiltration of dust, dirt, or water into the refrigerant circuit may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

Apply ester oil, ether oil, or a small amount of alkyl benzene to flares and flanges. The use and accidental infiltration of mineral oil into the system may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

To reduce the risk of oxidized film from entering the refrigerant pipe and causing the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damaging the compressor, braze pipes under nitrogen purge.

Do not use the existing refrigerant piping. A large amount of chloride that is contained in the residual refrigerant and refrigerant oil in the existing piping may cause the refrigerant oil in the new unit to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

Charge refrigerant in the liquid state. If refrigerant is charged in the gas phase, the composition of the refrigerant in the cylinder will change, compromising the unit's performance.

Do not use a charging cylinder. The use of a charging cylinder will change the composition of the refrigerant, compromising the unit's performance.

Charge the system with an appropriate amount of refrigerant in the liquid phase. Refer to the relevant sections in the manuals to calculate the appropriate amount of refrigerant to be charged. Refrigerant overcharge or undercharge may result in performance drop or abnormal stop of operation.

To reduce the risk of power capacity shortage, always use a dedicated power supply circuit.

To reduce the risk of both the breaker on the product side and the upstream breaker from tripping and causing problems, split the power supply system or provide protection coordination between the earth leakage breaker and no-fuse breaker.

Have a backup system, if failure of the unit has a potential for causing significant problems or damages.

## 1Check Before Servicing 1-1 Preparation for Piping Work

## 1-1-1 Read before Servicing

- 1. Check the type of refrigerant used in the system to be serviced.

Refrigerant Type

Multi air conditioner for building application CITY MULTI H2i (Hyper Heating Inverter) R2 TKMU-A-H, YKMU-A series : R410A

- 2. Check the symptoms exhibited by the unit to be serviced.

Refer to this service handbook for symptoms relating to the refrigerant cycle.

- 3. Thoroughly read the safety precautions at the beginning of this manual.
- 4. Preparing necessary tools: Prepare a set of tools to be used exclusively with each type of refrigerant.

For information about the correct use of tools, refer to the following page(s). [1-1-2 Tool Preparation](page 4)

- 5. Verification of the connecting pipes: Verify the type of refrigerant used for the unit to be moved or replaced.
-  Use refrigerant pipes made of phosphorus deoxidized copper. Keep the inner and outer surfaces of the pipes clean and free of such contaminants as sulfur, oxides, dust, dirt, shaving particles, oil, and water. These types of contaminants inside the refrigerant pipes may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate.
-  These types of contaminants inside the refrigerant pipes may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate.
- 6. If there is a leak of gaseous refrigerant and the remaining refrigerant is exposed to an open flame, a poisonous gas hydrofluoric acid may form. Keep workplace well ventilated.

CAUTION

-  Install new pipes immediately after removing old ones to keep moisture out of the refrigerant circuit.
-  The use of refrigerant that contains chloride, such as R22, will cause the refrigerating machine oil to deteriorate.

## 1-1-2 Tool Preparation

Prepare the following tools and materials necessary for installing and servicing the unit.

## Tools for use with R410A (Adaptability of tools that are for use with R22 or R407C)

- 1. To be used exclusively with R410A (not to be used if used with R22 or R407C)

## 1-2 Handling and Characteristics of Piping Materials, Refrigerant, and Refrigerant Oil

## 1-2-1 Piping Materials

## Do not use the existing piping!

## 1. Copper pipe materials

| O-material (Annealed)   | Soft copper pipes (annealed copper pipes). They can easily be bent with hands.                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1/2H-material (Drawn)   | Hard copper pipes (straight pipes). They are stronger than the O-material (Annealed)  at the same radial thickness. |

-  The distinction between O-materials (Annealed) and 1/2H-materials (Drawn) is made based on the strength of the pipes themselves.
-  O-materials (Annealed) can easily be bent with hands.
-  1/2H-materials (Drawn) are considerably stronger than O-material (Annealed) at the same thickness.

## 2. Types of copper pipes

| Maximum working pressure   | Refrigerant type   |
|----------------------------|--------------------|
| 3.45 MPa [500psi]          | R22, R407C etc.    |
| 4.30 MPa [624psi]          | R410A etc.         |

## 3. Piping materials/Radial thickness

- Use refrigerant pipes made of phosphorus deoxidized copper.
- The operation pressure of the units that use R410A is higher than that of the units that use R22.

Use pipes that have at least the radial thickness specified in the chart below.

(Pipes with a radial thickness of 0.7 mm or less may not be used.)

-  The pipes in the system that uses the refrigerant currently on the market are made with O-material (Annealed), even if the pipe diameter is less than ø19.05 (3/4"). For a system that uses R410A, use pipes that are made with 1/2H-material (Drawn) unless the pipe diameter is at least ø19.05 (3/4") and the radial thickness is at least 1.2t.
-  The figures in the radial thickness column are based on the Japanese standards and provided only as a reference. Use pipes that meet the local standards.

## 4. Thickness and refrigerant type indicated on the piping materials

Ask the pipe manufacturer for the symbols indicated on the piping material for new refrigerant.

## 5. Flare processing (O-material (Annealed) and OL-material only)

The flare processing dimensions for the pipes that are used in the R410A system are larger than those in the R22 system.

## Flare processing dimensions (mm[in])

|                    |                    | A dimension (mm)   | A dimension (mm)   |

If a clutch-type flare tool is used to flare the pipes in the system using R410A, the length of the pipes must be between 1.0 and 1.5 mm. For margin adjustment, a copper pipe gauge is necessary.

## 6. Flare nut

The flare nut type has been changed to increase the strength. The size of some of the flare nuts have also been changed.

Flare nut dimensions (mm[in])

The figures in the radial thickness column are based on the Japanese standards and provided only as a reference. Use pipes that meet the local standards.

## 1-2-2 Storage of Piping Materials

## 1. Storage location

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Store the pipes to be used indoors. (Warehouse at site or owner's warehouse) If they are left outdoors, dust, dirt, or moisture may infiltrate and contaminate the pipe.

## 2. Sealing the pipe ends

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Both ends of the pipes should be sealed until just before brazing. Keep elbow pipes and T-joints in plastic bags.

The new refrigerator oil is 10 times as hygroscopic as the conventional refrigerating machine oil (such as Suniso) and, if not handled with care, could easily introduce moisture into the system. Keep moisture out of the pipes, for it will cause the oil to deteriorate and cause a compressor failure.

## 1-2-3 Pipe Processing

Use a small amount of ester oil, ether oil, or alkylbenzene to coat flares and flanges.

-  Use a minimum amount of oil.
-  Use only ester oil, ether oil, and alkylbenzene.

## 1-2-4 Characteristics of the New and Conventional Refrigerants

## 1. Chemical property

As with R22, the new refrigerant (R410A) is low in toxicity and chemically stable nonflammable refrigerant. However, because the specific gravity of vapor refrigerant is greater than that of air, leaked refrigerant in a closed room will accumulate at the bottom of the room and may cause hypoxia. If exposed to an open flame, refrigerant will generate poisonous gases. Do not perform installation or service work in a confined area.

## 2. Refrigerant composition

R410A is a pseudo-azeotropic HFC blend and can almost be handled the same way as a single refrigerant, such as R22. To be safe, however, draw out the refrigerant from the cylinder in the liquid phase. If the refrigerant in the gaseous phase is drawn out, the composition of the remaining refrigerant will change and become unsuitable for use. If the refrigerant leaks out, it may be replenished. The entire refrigerant does not need to be replaced.

## 3. Pressure characteristics

The pressure in the system using R410A is 1.6 times as great as that in the system using R22.

## 1-2-5 Refrigerant Oil

## 1. Refrigerating machine oil in the HFC refrigerant system

HFC type refrigerants use a refrigerating machine oil different from that used in the R22 system. Note that the ester oil used in the system has properties that are different from commercially available ester oil.

| Refrigerant   | Refrigerating machine oil   |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| R22           | Mineral oil                 |
| R407C         | Ester oil                   |
| R410A         | Ester oil                   |

## 2. Effects of contaminants *1

Refrigerating machine oil used in the HFC system must be handled with special care to keep contaminants out. The table below shows the effect of contaminants in the refrigerating machine oil on the refrigeration cycle.

## 1-3 Working with Refrigerant Piping

## 1-3-1 Pipe Brazing

No changes have been made in the brazing procedures. Perform brazing with special care to keep foreign objects (such as oxide scale, water, and dust) out of the refrigerant system.

Example: Inside the brazed connection

Use of no inert gas during brazing

Use of inert gas during brazing

<!-- image -->

## 1. Items to be strictly observed

-  Do not conduct refrigerant piping work outdoors if raining.
-  Use inert gas during brazing.
-  Use a brazing material (BCuP-3) that requires no flux when brazing between copper pipes or between a copper pipe and copper coupling.
-  If installed refrigerant pipes are not immediately connected to the equipment, then braze and seal both ends.

## 2. Reasons

-  The new refrigerating machine oil is 10 times as hygroscopic as the conventional oil and is more likely to cause unit failure if water infiltrates into the system.
-  Flux generally contains chloride. Residual flux in the refrigerant circuit will cause sludge to form.

## 3. Notes

Do not use commercially available antioxidants because they may cause the pipes to corrode or refrigerating machine oil to deteriorate.

<!-- image -->

## 1-3-2 Air Tightness Test

No changes have been made in the detection method. Note that a refrigerant leak detector for R22 will not detect an R410A leak.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 1. Items to be strictly observed

 Pressurize the equipment with nitrogen up to the design pressure (4.15MPa[601psi]), and then judge the equipment's air tightness, taking temperature variations into account.

-  Refrigerant R410A must be charged in its liquid state (vs. gaseous state).

## 2. Reasons

 Oxygen, if used for an air tightness test, poses a risk of explosion. (Only use nitrogen to check air tightness.)  Refrigerant R410A must be charged in its liquid state. If gaseous refrigerant in the cylinder is drawn out first, the composition of the remaining refrigerant in the cylinder will change and become unsuitable for use.

## 3. Notes

Procure a leak detector that is specifically designed to detect an HFC leak. A leak detector for R22 will not detect an HFC(R410A) leak.

## 1-3-3 Vacuum Drying

<!-- image -->

(Photo1) 15010H

(Photo2) 14010

Recommended vacuum gauge:

ROBINAIR 14010 Thermistor Vacuum Gauge

## 1. Vacuum pump with a reverse-flow check valve (Photo1)

To prevent the vacuum pump oil from flowing into the refrigerant circuit during power OFF or power failure, use a vacuum pump with a reverse-flow check valve.

## 2. Standard of vacuum degree (Photo 2)

Use a vacuum pump that attains 0.5Torr(65Pa) or lower degree of vacuum after 5 minutes of operation, and connect it directly to the vacuum gauge. Use a pump well-maintained with an appropriate lubricant. A poorly maintained vacuum pump may not be able to attain the desired degree of vacuum.

## 3. Required precision of vacuum gauge

Use a vacuum gauge that registers a vacuum degree of 5Torr(650Pa) and measures at intervals of 1Torr(130Pa). (A recommended vacuum gauge is shown in Photo2.)

Do not use a commonly used gauge manifold because it cannot register a vacuum degree of 5Torr(650Pa).

## 4. Evacuation time

 After the degree of vacuum has reached 5Torr(650Pa), evacuate for an additional 1 hour. (A thorough vacuum drying removes moisture in the pipes.)

-  Verify that the vacuum degree has not risen by more than 1Torr(130Pa) 1hour after evacuation. A rise by less than 1Torr(130Pa) is acceptable.
-  If the vacuum is lost by more than 1Torr(130Pa), conduct evacuation, following the instructions in section 6. Special vacuum drying.

## 5. Procedures for stopping vacuum pump

To prevent the reverse flow of vacuum pump oil, open the relief valve on the vacuum pump side, or draw in air by loosening the charge hose, and then stop the operation.

The same procedures should be followed when stopping a vacuum pump with a reverse-flow check valve.

## 6. Special vacuum drying

-  When 5Torr(650Pa) or lower degree of vacuum cannot be attained after 3 hours of evacuation, it is likely that water has penetrated the system or that there is a leak.
-  If water infiltrates the system, break the vacuum with nitrogen. Pressurize the system with nitrogen gas to
- 0.5kgf/cm$^{2}$G(0.05MPa) and evacuate again. Repeat this cycle of pressurizing and evacuation either until the degree of vacuum below 5Torr(650Pa) is attained or until the pressure stops rising.
-  Only use nitrogen gas for vacuum breaking. (The use of oxygen may result in an explosion.)

<!-- image -->

## 7. Triple Evacuation

- The method below can also be used to evacuate the system.
-  Evacuate the system to 4,000 microns from both service valves. System manifold gauges must not be used to measure vacuum. A micron gauge must be used at all times. Break the vacuum with Nitrogen (N2) into the discharge service valve to 0 PSIG.
-  Evacuate the system to 1,500 microns from the suction service valve. Break the vacuum with Nitrogen (N2) into the discharge service valve to 0 PSIG.
-  Evacuate the system to 500 microns. System must hold the vacuum at 500 microns for a minimum of 1 hour.
-  Conduct a rise test for a minimum of 30 minutes

## 8. Notes

-  To evacuate air from the entire system
- Applying a vacuum through the check joints at the refrigerant service valve on the high and low pressure sides (BV1 and 2) is not enough to attain the desired vacuum pressure.
- Be sure to apply a vacuum through the check joints at the refrigerant service valve on the high and low pressure sides (BV1 and 2) and also through the check joints on the high and low pressure sides (CJ1 and 2). To evacuate air only from the outdoor units
-  To evacuate air only from the outdoor units
- Apply a vacuum through the check joints on the high and low pressure sides (CJ1, and 2).
-  To evacuate air from the indoor units and extension pipes
- Apply a vacuum through the check joints at the refrigerant service valve on the high and low pressure sides (BV1 and 2).

## 1-3-4 Refrigerant Charging

Cylinder with a siphon

Cylinder color R410A is pink.

<!-- image -->

Refrigerant charging in the liquid state

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 1. Reasons

R410A is a pseudo-azeotropic HFC blend (boiling point R32=-52°C[-62°F], R125=-49°C[-52°F]) and can almost be handled the same way as a single refrigerant, such as R22. To be safe, however, draw out the refrigerant from the cylinder in the liquid phase. If the refrigerant in the gaseous phase is drawn out, the composition of the remaining refrigerant will change and become unsuitable for use.

## 2. Notes

When using a cylinder with a siphon, refrigerant is charged in the liquid state without the need for turning it upside down. Check the type of the cylinder on the label before use.

If the refrigerant leaks out, it may be replenished. The entire refrigerant does not need to be replaced. (Charge refrigerant in the liquid state.)

Refer to the following page(s).[8-14 Measures for Refrigerant Leakage](page 311)

## 1-4 Precautions for Wiring

-  Control boxes house high-voltage and high-temperature electrical parts.
-  They may still remain energized or hot after the power is turned off.
-  When opening or closing the front cover of the control box, keep out of contact with the internal parts.
- Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, leave the unit turned off for at least 10 minutes, and check that the voltage of the electrolytic capacitor (inverter main circuit) has dropped to 20 VDC or less.
- It will take approximately 10 minutes until the voltage is discharged after power off.
-  Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work.
- Before connecting or disconnecting the connector, check that the outdoor unit fan is stopped and that the voltage of the main circuit capacitor has dropped to 20 VDC or below.
- If the outdoor unit fan is rotated by external forces such as strong winds, the main circuit capacitor can be charged and cause an electric shock.

Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.

Reconnect the connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.

-  When the unit is turned on, the compressor will remain energized even when it is stopped to vaporize the liquid refrigerant that accumulates in the compressor.
-  Before connecting wiring to TB7, check that the voltage has dropped below 20 VDC.
-  When a system controller is connected to the centralized control transmission cable to which power is supplied from the outdoor unit (power jumper on the outdoor unit is connected to CN40), be aware that power can be supplied to the centralized control transmission and the system controller may detect an error and send an error notice if the outdoor unit fan is rotated by external forces, such as strong winds, even when power to the outdoor unit is turned off.
-  When replacing the internal electrical components of the control box, tighten the screws to the recommended tightening torque as specified below.

Recommended tightening torque for the internal electrical components of the control box

|   Screw | Recommended tightening torque (N·m)   |
|---------|---------------------------------------|
|    0.69 | M3                                    |
|    1.47 | M4                                    |
|    2.55 | M5                                    |
|    2.75 | M6                                    |
|    6.2  | M8                                    |

- ∗ 1 When replacing semiconductor modules (e.g., diode stack, IPM, INV board (with IPM), fan board (with IPM)), apply heatsink silicone evenly to the mounting surface of the semiconductor module (or the semiconductor module on the back of the circuit board). Next, tighten the screws holding the semiconductor module to one-third of the specified torque, and then tighten the screws to the specified torque.
- ∗ 2 Deviating from the recommended tightening torque may cause damage to the unit or its parts.
- Take the following steps to ensure that the screws are properly tightened.
- 1) Ensure that the spring washers are parallel to the terminal block.
- Even if the tightening torque is observed, if the washers are not parallel to the terminal block, then the semiconductor module is not installed properly.

<!-- image -->

- 2) Check the wires are securely fastened to the screw terminals.
-  Screw the screws straight down so as not to damage the screw threads.
- Hold the two round terminals back to back to ensure that the screw will screw down straight.
-  After tightening the screw, mark a line through the screw head, washer, and terminals with a permanent marker.

## Example

Power supply terminal block, indoor-outdoor transmission line terminal block, and centralized controller transmission line

<!-- image -->

Poor contact caused by loose screws may result in overheating and fire. Continued use of the damaged circuit board may cause overheating and fire.

- 1) Have all electrical work performed by an authorized electrician according to the local regulations and instructions in this manual.
- 2) Install external transmission cables at least 5cm [1-31/32"] away from the power supply cable to avoid noise interference. (Do not put the control cable and power supply cable in the same conduit tube.)
- 3) Provide grounding for the outdoor unit as required.
- 4) Run the cable from the electric box of the indoor or outdoor unit in such way that the box is accessible for servicing.
- 5) Do not connect power supply wiring to the terminal block for transmission line. Doing so will damage the electronic components on the terminal block.
- 6) Use 2-core shielded cables as transmission cables.

Use a separate 2-core control cable for each refrigerant system. Do not use a single multiple-core cable to connect indoor units that belong to different refrigerant systems. The use of a multiple-core cable may result in signal transmission errors and malfunctions.

- 7) When extending the transmission cable, be sure to extend the shield wire.

## (2) Control wiring

Different types of control wiring are used for different systems. Before performing wiring work, refer to the following page(s).

[2-7 Example System with an MA Remote Controller](page 32)

[2-8 Example System with an ME Remote Controller](page 46)

[2-9 Example System with an MA and an ME Remote Controller](page 48)

## Types and maximum allowable length of cables

Control lines are categorized into 2 types: transmission line and remote controller line.

Use the appropriate type of cables and observe the maximum allowable length specified for a given system. If a given system has a long transmission line or if a noise source is located near the unit, place the unit away from the noise source to reduce noise interference.

## 2-4-3 Outdoor Unit Centralized Controller Switch Setting

| System configuration                              | Centralized control switch (SW5-1) settings * 1   |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Connection to the system controller Not connected | Leave it to OFF. (Factory setting)                |
| Connection to the system controller Connected *   | ON                                                |

- *1 Set SW5-1 on all outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit to the same setting.
- *2 When only the LM adapter is connected, leave SW5-1 to OFF (as it is).

## 2-4-4 Room Temperature Detection Position Selection

To stop the fan during heating Thermo-OFF (SW1-7 and 1-8 on the indoor units to be set to ON), use the built-in thermistor on the remote controller or an optional thermistor.

- 1) To use the built-in sensor on the remote controller, set the SW1-1 to ON.
- (Factory setting: SW1-1 set to "OFF".)
-  Some models of remote controllers are not equipped with a built-in temperature sensor.
- Use the built-in temperature sensor on the indoor unit instead.
-  When using the built-in sensor on the remote controller, install the remote controller where room temperature can be detected. (Note) Factory setting for SW1-1 on the indoor unit of the All-Fresh Models is ON.
- 2) When an optional temperature sensor is used, set SW1-1 to OFF, and set SW3-8 to ON.
-  When using an optional temperature sensor, install it where room temperature can be detected.

## 2-4-5 Start/Stop Control of Indoor Units

Each indoor unit (or group of indoor units) can be controlled individually by setting SW 1-9 and 1-10.

| Automatic restoration  after power failure | Indoor unit will go into operation if it was in operation when the power was  turned off (or cut off due to power failure). (In approx. 5 minutes) | ON                    | OFF                   |
| Automatic restoration  after power failure | Indoor unit will remain stopped regardless of its operation status before  power off (power failure).                                              | OFF                   | OFF                   |

- *1. Do not cut off power to the outdoor unit. Cutting off the power supply to the outdoor unit will cut off the power supply to the belt heater and may cause the compressor to malfunction when the unit is put back into operation.
- *3. Models with a built-in drain pump cannot be turned on/off by the plug individually. All the units in the same refrigerant circuits will be turned on or off by the plug.
- *2. Not applicable to units with a built-in drain pump or humidifier.
- *4. Requires that the dipswitch settings for all the units in the group be made.
- *5. To control the external input to and output from the air conditioners with the PLC software for general equipment via the G(B)-50A, set SW1-9 and SW1-10 to ON. With these settings made, the power start-stop function becomes disabled. To use the auto recovery function after power failure while these settings are made, set SW1-5 to ON.

## 2-4-6 Miscellaneous Settings

Cooling-only setting for the indoor unit: Cooling only model (Factory setting: SW3-1 "OFF.") When using indoor unit as a cooling-only unit, set SW3-1 to ON.

## 2-5 Demand Control Overview

## (1) General outline of control

Demand control is performed by using the external signal input to the 1-2 and 1-3 pins of CN3D on the outdoor units (OC and OS). Between 2 and 8 steps of demand control is possible by setting Dip SW6-8 on the outdoor units (OC and OS).

| No   | Demand control switch                | Dip SW6-8   | Dip SW6-8   | Input to CN3D* 2   |
|------|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| No   | Demand control switch                | OC          | OS          | Input to CN3D* 2   |
| 1    | 2 steps (0-100%)                     | OFF         | OFF         | OC                 |
| 2    | 4 steps (0-50-75-100%)               | ON          | OFF         | OC                 |
| 3    | 4 steps (0-50-75-100%)               | OFF         | ON          | OS                 |
| 4    | 8 steps   (0-25-38-50-63-75-88-100%) | ON          | ON          | OC and OS          |

- *1 Available demand functions
- HP72 - HP96T(Y)KMU-A(-H) models (single-outdoor-unit system) : 2 and 4 steps shown in the rows 1 and 2 in the table above only.
- HP144 - HP192T(Y)KMU-A(-H) models (two-outdoor-unit system OC+OS) : 2-8 steps shown in the rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the table above only.
- *2 Signal is input to CN3D on the outdoor unit whose SW6-8 is set to ON. When SW6-8 is set to OFF on all outdoor units, the signal is input to the CN3D on the OC.
- *3 If wrong sequence of steps are taken, the units may go into the Thermo-OFF (compressor stop) mode.
- *3 If wrong sequence of steps are taken, the units may go into the Thermo-OFF (compressor stop) mode.

Ex) When switching from 100% to 50%

- (Incorrect) 100% → 0% → 50% The units may go into the Thermo-OFF mode.
- (Correct) 100% 75% 50%
- *4 The percentage of the demand listed in the table above is an approximate value based on the compressor volume and does not necessarily correspond with the actual capacity.
- *5 Notes on using demand control in combination with the low-noise mode
- To enable the low-noise mode, it is necessary to short-circuit 1-2 pin of CN3D on the outdoor unit whose SW6-8 is set to OFF. When SW6-8 is set to ON on all outdoor units, the following operations cannot be performed.
-  Performing 4-step demand in combination with the low-noise operation in a single-outdoor-unit system.
- Performing 8-step demand in combination with the low-noise operation in a two-outdoor-unit system.

## 1) Contact input and control content

## 2-step demand control

The same control as the Thermo-OFF is performed by closing 1-3 pin of CN3D.

|      | CN3D   |
|------|--------|
| 1-3  | CN3D   |
| Open | 100%   |

## 4-step demand control (When SW6-8 is set to ON on an outdoor unit)

Demand capacity is shown below.

| CN3D   | 1-2P   | 1-2P   |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1-3P   | Open   | Close  |
| Open   | 100%   | 75%    |
| Close  | 0%     | 50%    |

## 8-step demand control (When SW6-8 is set to ON on two outdoor units)

Demand capacity is shown below.

| 8-step demand   | 8-step demand   | No.2 CN3D   | No.2 CN3D   | No.2 CN3D   | No.2 CN3D   | No.2 CN3D   |

## (2) Cautions

- 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
- 2) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR-30MAAU.
- 3) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below, one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.
- To connect two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number of connectable indoor units that are listed in the specifications for each outdoor unit.)

|                                                                               | Number of transmission  booster (sold separately) re- quired   | Number of transmission  booster (sold separately) re- quired   |

-  The table above shows the number of transmission boosters that is required by the system with three BC controllers. For each BC controller that is subtracted from the abovementioned system, two additional indoor units can be connected.

- 4) Automatic address setup is not available if start-stop input (CN32, CN51, CN41) is used for a group operation of indoor units or when multiple indoor units with different functions are grouped in the same group. Refer to the following page(s). [2-7-2 Single Refrigerant System with Two or More LOSSNAY Units](page 34)
- 5) For information about connecting two or more LOSSNAY units to a system, refer to the following page(s). [2-7-2 Single Refrigerant System with Two or More LOSSNAY Units](page 34)

## (3) Maximum allowable length

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line Maximum distance (1.25mm$^{2}$ [AWG16] or larger) L1 +L2+L3+L4+L5 200m[656ft] +L2+L3+L11+L12+L13
- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

No connection is required.

Maximum overall line length (0.3 to 1.25mm$^{2}$ [AWG22 to 16]) m1 200m [656ft] m2+m3 200m [656ft] m4+m5

*When connected to the terminal block on the Simple remote controller, use cables that meet the following cable size specifications: 0.75 - 1.25 mm$^{2}$ [AWG18-14]. *When connecting PAR-30MAAU, use a 0.3 mm$^{2}$ sheathed cable.

## (4) Wiring method

## 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Daisy-chain terminals M1 and M2 of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB3) on the outdoor units (OC and OS), of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB02) on the main BC controller (BC), and of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB5) on each indoor unit (IC). (Non-polarized two-wire)

-  Only use shielded cables.

The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS in the order of capacity from large to small (if two or more units have the same capacity, in the order of address from small to large).

## Shielded cable connection

Daisy-chain the ground terminal ( ) on the outdoor units (OC and OS), the S terminal of the terminal block (TB02) on the BC controller (BC), and the S terminal of the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) with the shield of the shielded cable.

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

No connection is required.

- 3) MA remote controller wiring

Connect terminals 1 and 2 on the terminal block for MA remote controller line (TB15) on the indoor unit (IC) to the terminal block on the MA remote controller (MA). (Non-polarized two-wire)

## When 2 remote controllers are connected to the system

When 2 remote controllers are connected to the system, connect terminals 1 and 2 of the terminal block (TB15) on the indoor unit (IC) to the terminal block on the two MA

remote controllers.

 Set one of the MA remote controllers as a sub controller. (Refer to the Instruction Manual for the MA remote controller for the setting method.)

## Group operation of indoor units

To perform a group operation of indoor units (IC), daisychain terminals 1 and 2 on the terminal block (TB15) on all indoor units (IC) in the same group, and then connect terminals 1 and 2 on the terminal block (TB15) on the indoor unit on one end to the terminal block on the MA remotecontroller. (Non-polarized two-wire)

-  When performing a group operation of indoor units that have different functions, "Automatic indoor/outdoor addresssetup" is not available.

## 4) LOSSNAY connection

Connect terminals M1 and M2 on the terminal block(TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) to the appropriate terminals on the terminal block (TB5) on LOSSNAY (LC). (Non-polarized two-wire)

-  Interlock operation setting with all the indoor units in the same system will automatically be made. (It is required that the Lossnay unit be turned on before the outdoorunit.)

 For information about certain types of systems (1. Systems in which the LOSSNAY unit is interlocked with only part of the indoor units, 2. Systems in which the LOSSNAY unit is operated independently from the indoor units, 3. Systems in which more than 16 indoor units are interlocked with the LOSSNAY unit, and 4. Systems to which two ore more LOSSNAY units are connected), refer to the following page(s). [2-7-2 Single Refrigerant System with Two or More LOSSNAY Units](page 34)

The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS.

They are designated as OC and OS in the descending order of capacity (ascending order of address if the capacities are the same).

## 2-7-2 Single Refrigerant System with Two or More LOSSNAY Units

## (1) Sample control wiring

<!-- image -->

* If the BC address overlaps any of the addresses that are assigned to either the OC, OS, or BS, use a different, unused address. OC, OS, and BS addresses (lowest indoor unit address in the group plus +50) have higher priority than the BS address.

## (2) Cautions

- 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
- 2) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR30MAAU.
- 3) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below, one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.
- To connect two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number of connectable indoor units that are listed in the specifications for each outdoor unit.)

|                                                                              | Number of transmission  booster (sold separately)  required   | Number of transmission  booster (sold separately)  required   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                              | 1 unit                                                        | 2 units                                                       |
| When the P72 and P96 models are not in- cluded in the connected indoor units | 27 - 50  units                                                | -                                                             |
| When the P72 and P96 models are includ- ed in the connected indoor units     | 21 - 39  units                                                | 40 - 50  units                                                |

-  The table above shows the number of transmission boosters that is required by the system with three BC controllers. For each BC controller that is subtracted from the abovementioned system, two additional indoor units can be connected.
-  Refer to the DATABOOK for further information about how many booster units are required for a given system.

## (3) Maximum allowable length

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Same as 2-7-1

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

No connection is required.

- 3) MA remote controller wiring

Same as 2-7-1

## (4) Wiring method

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Daisy-chain terminals M1 and M2 of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB3) on the outdoor units (OC and OS), of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB02) on the main and sub BC controllers (BC and BS), and of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB5) on each indoor unit (IC). (Non-polarized two-wire)

-  Only use shielded cables.

The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS in the order of capacity from large to small (if two or more units have the same capacity, in the order of address from small to large).

## Shielded cable connection

Daisy-chain the ground terminal ( ) on the outdoor units (OC and OS), the S terminal of the terminal block (TB02) on BC and BS, and the S terminal of the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) with the shield of the shielded cable.

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

No connection is required.

- 3) MA remote controller wiring

Same as 2-7-1

When 2 remote controllers are connected to the system

Same as 2-7-1

## Group operation of indoor units

Same as 2-7-1

## 4) LOSSNAY connection

Connect terminals M1 and M2 on the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) to the appropriate terminals on the terminal block (TB5) on LOSSNAY (LC). (Non-polarized two-wire)

 Interlock setting between the indoor units and LOSSNAY units must be entered on the remote controller. For information about how to interlock the operation of indoor and LOSSNAY units, refer to the following page(s) in this Service Handbook.

[6-5 Making Interlock Settings from an MA Remote Controller](page 157)

- 5) Switch setting

Address setting is required as follows.

The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS. They are designated as OC and OS in the descending order of capacity (ascending order of address if the capacities are the same).

## 2-7-3 Grouped Operation of Units in Separate Refrigerant Circuits

## (1) Sample control wiring

<!-- image -->

## (2) Cautions

- 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
- 2) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR-30MAAU.
- 3) Do not connect the terminal blocks (TB5) on the indoor units that are connected to different outdoor units with each other.
- 4) Replacement of male power jumper connector (CN41) must be performed only on one of the outdoor units.
- 5) Provide grounding to S terminal on the terminal block for transmission line for centralized control (TB7) on only one of the outdoor units.
- 6) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below, one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.
- To connect two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number of connectable indoor units that are listed in the specifications for each outdoor unit.)

| When the P72 and P96 mod- els are not included in the con- nected indoor units | 27 - 50 units                                                 | -                                                             |
| When the P72 and P96 mod- els are included in the con- nected indoor units     | 21 - 39 units                                                 | 40 - 50 units                                                 |

-  The left table shows the number of transmission boosters that is required by the system with three BC controllers. For each BC controller that is subtracted from the above-mentioned system, two additional indoor units can be connected.
-  Refer to the DATABOOK for further information about how many booster units are required for a given system.

## (3) Maximum allowable length

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Maximum distance (1.25mm$^{2}$ [AWG16] or larger) L11+L12 200m [656ft] L21+L22

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control L31+L21 200m [656ft]
- 3) MA remote controller wiring

Same as 2-7-1

- 4) Maximum line distance via outdoor unit (1.25mm$^{2}$ [AWG16] or larger) L12(L11)+L31+L22(L21) 500m [1640ft]

## (4) Wiring method

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Same as 2-7-2

Shielded cable connection

Same as 2-7-2

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

Daisy-chain terminals M1 and M2 on the terminal block for transmission line for centralized control (TB7) on the outdoor units (OC) in different refrigerant circuits and on the OC and OS (Note a) in the same refrigerant circuit. If a power supply unit is not connected to the transmission line for centralized control, replace the power jumper connector on the control board from CN41 to CN40 on only one of the outdoor units.

- a) The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS in the order of capacity from large to small (if two or more units have the same capacity, in the order of address from small to large).
- b) If TB7's on the outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are not daisy-chained, connect the transmission line for the central control system to TB7 of the OC. (Note a).To maintain the central control even during an OC failure or a power failure, connect TB7 on OC and OS together. (If there is a

problem with the outdoor unit whose power jumper was moved from CN41 to CN40, central control is not possible, even if TB7's are daisy-chained.)

- c) When connecting TB7, only commence after checking that the voltage is below 20 VDC.

 Only use shielded cables.

## Shielded cable connection

Daisy-chain the S terminal on the terminal block (TB7) on the outdoor units (OC, OS) with the shield wire of the shielded cable. Short-circuit the earth terminal ( ) and the S terminal on the terminal block (TB7) on the outdoor unit whose power jumper connector is mated with CN40.

## 2-7-4 System with a Connection of System Controller to Centralized Control Transmission Line

## (1) Sample control wiring

An example of a system in which a system controller is connected to the transmission cable for the centralized control system and the power is supplied from the outdoor unit

<!-- image -->

## (2) Cautions

- 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
- 2) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR-30MAAU.
- 3) Do not connect the terminal blocks (TB5) on the indoor units that are connected to different outdoor units with each other.
- 4) Replacement of male power jumper connector (CN41) must be performed only on one of the outdoor units.
- 5) When the System controller is connected TB7 side and TKMU outdoor unit model is used, connect a PAC-SC51KUA to TB7 side. If a PACSC51KUA cannnot be used, connect the System controller to TB3 side. When YKMU outdoor unit model is used, the male power supply connector can be connected to CN40, and the System controller can be connected to TB7 side.
- 6) Short-circuit the shield terminal (S terminal) and the earth terminal ( ) on the terminal block for transmission line for centralized control (TB7) on the outdoor unit whose power jumper connector is mated with CN40.
- 7) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below, one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.

To connect two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number of connectable indoor units that are listed in the specifications for each outdoor unit.)

|                                                                               | Number of transmission booster  (sold separately) required   | Number of transmission booster  (sold separately) required   |

| When the P72 and P96 models are  not included in the connected in- door units | 27 - 50 units                                                | -                                                            |
| When the P72 and P96 models are  included in the connected indoor  units      | 21 - 39 units                                                | 40 - 50 units                                                |

-  The left table shows the number of transmission boosters that is required by the system with three BC controllers. For each BC controller that is subtracted from the above-mentioned system, two additional indoor units can be connected.

 Refer to the DATABOOK for further information about how many booster units are required for a given system.

- 8) When a power supply unit is connected to the transmission line for centralized control, leave the power jumper connector on CN41 as it is (factory setting).

## (3) Maximum allowable length

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

## (4) Wiring method

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Same as 2-7-2

Only use shielded cables.

Shielded cable connection

Same as 2-7-2

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

Daisy-chain terminals A and B on the system controller, terminals M1 and M2 on the terminal block for transmission line for centralized control (TB7) on the outdoor units (OC) in different refrigerant circuits and on the outdoor units (OC and OS) in the same refrigerant circuit. (Note b)

If a power supply unit is not connected to the transmission line for centralized control, replace the power jumper connector on the control board from CN41 to CN40 on only one of the outdoor units.

- If a system controller is connected, set the central control switch (SW5-1) on the control board of all outdoor units to "ON."
- a) The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS in the order of capacity from large to small (if two or more units have the same capacity, in the order of address from small to large).
- b) If TB7's on the outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are not daisy-chained, connect the transmission line for the central control system to TB7 of the OC. (Note a).To maintain the central control even during an OC failure or a power failure, connect TB7 on OC and OS together. (If there is a problem with the outdoor unit whose power jumper was

moved from CN41 to CN40, central control is not possible, even if TB7's are daisy-chained.)

- c) When connecting TB7, only commence after checking that the voltage is below 20 VDC.

 Only use shielded cables.

## Shielded cable connection

Daisy-chain the S terminal of the terminal block (TB7) on the system controller, OC, and OS with the shield of the shielded cable. Short-circuit the earth terminal ( ) and the S terminal on the terminal block (TB7) on the outdoor unit whose power jumper connector is mated with CN40.

## 3) MA remote controller wiring

Same as 2-7-1

When 2 remote controllers are connected to the system Same as 2-7-1

## Group operation of indoor units

Same as 2-7-1

4)

LOSSNAY connection

Connect terminals M1 and M2 on the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) to the appropriate terminals on the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB5) on LOSSNAY (LC). (Non-polarized two-wire)

-  Indoor units must be interlocked with the LOSSNAY unit using the system controller. (Refer to the operation manual for the system controller for the setting method.) Interlock setting from the remote controller is required if the ON/OFF remote controller alone or the LM adapter alone is connected.

## 5) Switch setting

Address setting is required as follows.

They are designated as OC and OS in the descending order of capacity (ascending order of address if the capacities are the same).

## 2-7-5 System with a Connection of System Controller to Indoor-Outdoor Transmission Line

## (1) Sample control wiring

<!-- image -->

## (2) Cautions

- 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
- 2) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR-30MAAU.
- 3) Do not connect the terminal blocks (TB5) on the indoor units that are connected to different outdoor units with each other.
- 4) Replacement of male power jumper connector (CN41) must be performed only on one of the outdoor units.
- 5) Provide grounding to S terminal on the terminal block for transmission line for centralized control (TB7) on only one of the outdoor units.
- 6) A maximum of 3 system controllers can be connected to the indooroutdoor transmission line, with the exception that only one G(B)-50A may be connected.
- 7) When the total number of indoor units exceeds 20 (12 if one or more indoor units of the 72 model or above is connected), it may not be possible to connect a system controller to the indoor-outdoor transmission line.
- 8) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below, one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.
- To connect two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number of connectable indoor units that are listed in the specifications for each outdoor unit.)

Note1 LM adapters cannot be connected to the indoor-outdoor transmission line.

| When the P72 and P96 models are not  included in the connected indoor units | 27 - 50 units                                                 | -                                                             |
| When the P72 and P96 models are in- cluded in the connected indoor units    | 21 - 39 units                                                 | 40 - 50 units                                                 |

-  The table above shows the number of transmission boosters that is required by the system with three BC controllers. For each BC controller that is subtracted from the above-mentioned system, two additional indoor units can be connected.
-  Refer to the DATABOOK for further information about how many booster units are required for a given system.

## (3) Maximum allowable length

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Maximum distance (1.25mm$^{2}$ [AWG16] or larger) L11+L12 200m [656ft] L21+L22 L25 200m [656ft]

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

L31+L21

200m [656ft]

- 3) MA remote controller wiring

Same as 2-7-1

- 4) Maximum line distance via outdoor unit (1.25mm 2 [AWG16] or larger) L25+L31+L12(L11) 500m [1640ft] L12(L11)+L31+L22(L21)

## (4) Wiring method

## 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Daisy-chain terminals M1 and M2 of the terminal block for indooroutdoor transmission line (TB3) on the outdoor units (OC and OS) (Note a), of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB02) on the main and sub BC controllers (BC and BS), of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB5) on each indoor unit (IC), and the S terminal of the system controller.(Nonpolarized two-wire)

 Only use shielded cables.

- a) The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS in the order of capacity from large to small (if two or more units have the same capacity, in the order of address from small to large).

## Shielded cable connection

Daisy-chain the ground terminal ( ) on the outdoor units (OC and OS), the S terminal of the terminal block (TB02) on the BC and BS, and the S terminal of the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) with the shield of the shielded cable.

## 2) Transmission line for centralized control

Daisy-chain terminals M1 and M2 on the terminal block for transmission line for centralized control (TB7) on the outdoor units (OC) in different refrigerant circuits and on the OC and OS in the same refrigerant circuit. (Note b)

If a power supply unit is not connected to the transmission line for centralized control, replace the power jumper connector on the control board from CN41 to CN40 on only one of the outdoor units. Set the central control switch (SW5-1) on the control board of all outdoor units to "ON."

b) If TB7's on the outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are not

daisy-chained, connect the transmission line for the central control system to TB7 of the OC. (Note a).To maintain the central control even during an OC failure or a power failure, connect TB7 on OC and OS together. (If there is a problem with the outdoor unit whose power jumper was moved from CN41 to CN40, central control is not possible, even if TB7's are daisy-chained.)

- c) When connecting TB7, only commence after checking that the voltage is below 20 VDC.

 Only use shielded cables.

## Shielded cable connection

Daisy-chain the S terminal on the terminal block (TB7) on the outdoor units (OC, OS) with the shield wire of the shielded cable. Shortcircuit the earth terminal ( ) and the S terminal on the terminal block (TB7) on the outdoor unit whose power jumper connector is mated with CN40.

## 3) MA remote controller wiring

Same as 2-7-1

When 2 remote controllers are connected to the system Same as 2-7-1

## Group operation of indoor units

Same as 2-7-1

## 4) LOSSNAY connection

## 4) LOSSNAY connection

Connect terminals M1 and M2 on the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor units (IC) to the appropriate terminals on the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB5) on LOSSNAY (LC). (Non-polarized two-wire)

-  Indoor units must be interlocked with the LOSSNAY unit using the system controller. (Refer to the operation manual for the system controller for the setting method.) Interlock setting from the remote controller is required if the ON/OFF remote controller alone is connected.

## 5) Switch setting

Address setting is required as follows.

The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS.

They are designated as OC and OS in the descending order of capacity (ascending order of address if the capacities are the same).

## 2-7-6 System with Multiple BC Controllers

## (1) Sample control wiring

<!-- image -->

## (2) Cautions

- 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
- 2) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR-30MAAU.
- 3) Do not connect the terminal blocks (TB5) on the indoor units that are connected to different outdoor units with each other.
- 4) Replacement of male power jumper connector (CN41) must be performed only on one of the outdoor units.
- 5) Short-circuit the S (shield) terminal of the terminal block for the central control unit (TB7) and the ground terminal ( ) on the outdoor unit whose power jumper was moved from CN41 to CN40.
- 6) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below, one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.
- To connect two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number of connectable indoor units that are listed in the specifications for each outdoor unit.)

|                                                                              | Number of transmission  booster (sold separately)  required   | Number of transmission  booster (sold separately)  required   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                              | 1 unit                                                        | 2 units                                                       |

| When the P72 and P96 models are includ- ed in the connected indoor units     | 21 - 39  units                                                | 40 - 50  units                                                |

-  The table above shows the number of transmission boosters that is required by the system with three BC controllers. For each BC controller that is subtracted from the abovementioned system, two additional indoor units can be connected.
-  Refer to the DATABOOK for further information about how many booster units are required for a given system.
- 7) When a power supply unit is connected to the transmission line for centralized control, leave the power jumper connec-

tor on CN41 as it is (factory setting).

- (3) Maximum allowable length
- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Maximum distance (1.25mm$^{2}$ [AWG16] or larger) L11+L12 200m [656ft] L21+L22 200m [656ft]

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

L31+L32(L21)

200m [656ft]

- 3) MA remote controller wiring

4)

Maximum overall line length (0.3 to 1.25mm$^{2}$ [AWG22 to 16]) m1 200m [656ft] m2+m3 Maximum line distance via outdoor unit (1.25mm$^{2}$ [AWG16] or larger) L32+L31+L12(L11) 500m [1640ft] L32+L22(L21) 500m [1640ft] L12(L11)+L31+L22(L21) 500m[1640ft]

## (4) Wiring method

- 1) Indoor/outdoor transmission line

Daisy-chain terminals M1 and M2 of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB3) on the outdoor units (OC and OS) (Note a), of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB02) on the main and sub BC controllers (BC and BS), and of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB5) on each indoor unit (IC). (Non-polarized two-wire)

-  Only use shielded cables.
- a) The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS in the order of capacity from large to small (if two or more units have the same capacity, in the order of address from small to large).

## Shielded cable connection

Daisy-chain the ground terminal ( ) on the outdoor units (OC and OS), the S terminal of the terminal block (TB02) on the BC and BS, and the S terminal of the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) with the shield of the shielded cable.

- 2) Transmission line for centralized control

Daisy-chain terminals A and B of the system controller, M1 and M2 terminals of TB7 (terminal block for centralized control system connection) on the outdoor units (OC) in different refrigerant systems, and M1 and M2 terminals of TB7 (terminal block for centralized control system connection) on the outdoor units (OC and OS ) in the same refrigerant circuit. (Note b)

If a power supply unit is not connected to the transmission line for centralized control, replace the power jumper connector on the control board from CN41 to CN40 on only one of the outdoor units.

When connecting a system controller, set the centralized control switch (SW5-1) on the control board of all indoor units to "ON."

b) If TB7's on the outdoor units in the same refrigerant cir-

cuit are not daisy-chained, connect the transmission line for the central control system to TB7 of the OC. (Note a).To maintain the central control even during an OC failure or a power failure, connect TB7 on OC and OS together. (If there is a problem with the outdoor unit whose power jumper was moved from CN41 to CN40, central control is not possible, even if TB7's are daisy-chained.)

- c) When connecting TB7, only commence after checking that the voltage is below 20 VDC.

 Only use shielded cables.

## Shielded cable connection

Daisy-chain the S terminal of the terminal block (TB7) on the system controller, OC, and OS with the shield of the shielded cable. Short-circuit the earth terminal ( ) and the S terminal on the terminal block (TB7) on the outdoor unit whose power jumper connector is mated with CN40.

## 3) MA remote controller wiring

Same as 2-7-1

## When 2 remote controllers are connected to the system

Same as 2-7-1

Same as 2-7-1

## Group operation of indoor units

Same as 2-7-1

## 4) LOSSNAY connection

Connect terminals M1 and M2 on the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) to the appropriate terminals on the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB5) on LOSSNAY (LC). (Non-polarized two-wire)

-  Indoor units must be interlocked with the LOSSNAY unit using the system controller. (Refer to the operation manual for the system controller for the setting method.) Interlock setting from the remote controller is required if the ON/OFF remote controller alone or the LM adapter alone is connected.
- 5) Switch setting

Address setting is required as follows.

## 2-8 Example System with an ME Remote Controller

## 2-8-1 System with a Connection of System Controller to Centralized Control Transmission Line

## (1) Sample control wiring

<!-- image -->

## (2) Cautions

- 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
- 2) No more than 2 ME remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units.
- 3) Do not connect the terminal blocks (TB5) on the indoor units that are connected to different outdoor units with each other.
- 4) Replace the power jumper connector of the control board from CN41 to CN40 on only one of the outdoor units.
- 5) Provide an electrical path to ground for the S terminal on the terminal block for centralized control on only one of the outdoor units.
- 6) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below, one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.
- To connect two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number of connectable indoor units that are listed in the specifications for each outdoor unit.)

| When the P72 and P96 models are in- cluded in the connected indoor units    | 11 - 26  units                                               | 27 - 42  units                                               | 43 - 50  units                                               |

 The left table shows the number of transmission boosters

that is required by the system with three BC controllers. For each BC controller that is subtracted from the above-mentioned system, two additional indoor units can be connected.  Refer to the DATABOOK for further information about how many booster units are required for a given system.

- 7) When a power supply unit is connected to the transmission line for centralized control, leave the power jumper connector on CN41 as it is (factory setting).

## (3) Maximum allowable length

<!-- image -->

## (2) Cautions

- 1) Be sure to connect a system controller.
- 2) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
- 3) Assign to the indoor units connected to the MA remote controller addresses that are smaller than those of the indoor units that are connected to the ME remote controller.
- 4) No more than 2 ME remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units.
- 5) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR-30MAAU.
- 6) Do not connect the terminal blocks (TB5) on the indoor units that are connected to different outdoor units with each other.
- 7) Replace the power jumper connector of the control board from CN41 to CN40 on only one of the outdoor units.
- 8) Provide an electrical path to ground for the S terminal on the terminal block for centralized control on only one of the outdoor units.
- 9) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below, one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.
- To connect two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number of connectable indoor units that are

listed in the specifications for each outdoor unit.)

- *1. When the overall pipe length between the BC controller and the farthest indoor unit exceeds 40m [131ft], observe the restrictions in the figure titled "Restrictions on pipe length" below. (Except the P96 models)
- *2. When the capacity of the connected indoor units is P72 or above, use the figures in the parentheses as a reference.
- 1) To connect the P72 through P96 models of indoor units, use an optional twinning pipe kit (Model: CMY-R160-J) and merge the two ports before connecting them.
- 2) Do not connect the P72 or P96 models of indoor units and other models of indoor units at the same port.
- 3) Note the following when connecting multiple indoor units to a single port.
-  Those indoor units connected to the same port must be installed in the same room.
-  Set the indoor temperature via the connected remote controller, and when connecting multiple remote controllers, configure these controllers as a group by making appropriate settings. These indoor units can only be operated in the same mode.

## 4 Electrical Components and Wiring Diagrams 4-1 Outdoor Unit Circuit Board Arrangement

## 4-1-1 Outdoor Unit Control Box

## <HIGH VOLTAGE WARNING>

<!-- image -->

- Control box houses high-voltage parts.
- When opening or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact with any of the internal components.
- Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes, and check that the the voltage of the electrolytic capacitor (Inverter main circuit) is 20VDC or below. (It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turned off.)

## 1. PURY-HP72, HP96TKMU-A-H

- 1) Exercise caution not to damage the bottom and the front panel of the control box. Damage to these parts affect the waterproof and dust proof properties of the control box and may result in damage to its internal components.
- 2) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the cable heads are securely locked in place. Press the tab on the terminals to remove them.
- 3) Control box houses high temperature parts. Be well careful even after turning off the power source.
- 4) Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. To plug or unplugconnectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.
- 5) To connect wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.
- 6) Reconnect the connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.
- 7) When opening or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact with any of the internal components. Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes, and confirm that the capacitor voltage (inverter main circuit) has dropped to 20 VDC or less. It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turned off.
- 8) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.

- 6) Reconnect the connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.
- 7) When opening or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact with any of the internal components. Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes, and confirm that the capacitor voltage (inverter main circuit) has dropped to 20 V DC or less. It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turned off.
- 8) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.

- 1) To change the settings, set SW6-10 to ON, set SW4, and press and hold SWP01 for 2 seconds or longer (OFF ↔ ON). LED3 will light up when the switch setting is ON, and lights off when OFF.

Use the LED3 display to confirm that the settings are properly made.

- The settings will need to be set again when the control board is replaced. Write down the settings on the electrical wiring drawing label.
- 2) A: OC: Only the switch on OC needs to be set for the setting to be effective.
- B: OC: The switches on both the OC and OS need to be set to the same seeing for the setting to be effective.
- C: OC: The switches on both the OC and OS need to be set.
- D: OC: The switch on either the OC or OS needs to be set.
- 3) For details, refer to the following page(s).[5-2-7 Defrost Operation Control](page 127)
- 4) The table below shows how the target evaporation temperature is set with SW4 (982).

- 5) Unless otherwise specified, leave the switch to OFF where indicated by "-" or where the cells are blank, which may be set to OFF for a reason.
- 6) The settings that are configured with SW4 (SW6-10: ON) will automatically be stored on the indoor units that support the new function*. The stored settings will automatically be restored when the outdoor unit control board is replaced.
- If none of the connected indoor units supports the new function, no configuration information will be saved. If this is the case, manually record the settings configuration on the control box panel.
- *The new function is supported on most units that are manufactured in December of 2012 and later. Depending on the model, this function may be added on later date. Ask your dealer for further details.
- 7) The table below shows the combinations of the settings for items No.929 and No.935 and the Heating Capacity mode setting that corresponds to each combination.

|        |        | No.929           | No.929   |
|--------|--------|------------------|----------|
| Switch | Switch | OFF              | ON       |
| No.935 | OFF    | Intelligent Heat | Standard |
| No.935 | ON     | High Heat        | -        |

- 8) The default settings for the setting item No.974 on the PURY-HP-TKMU-A-H series units is "ON." Set this switch to "OFF" to output error signals. When this switchis set to "OFF," base heaters cannot be used.

Note 2. If both SW1-7 and SW1-8 are set to ON, the fan remains stopped during heating Thermo-OFF. Note 1. Settings in the shaded areas are factory settings.(Refer to the table below for the factory setting of the switches whose factory settings are not indicated by the shaded cells.)

To prevent incorrect temperature detection due to a build-up of warm air around the indoor unit, use the built-in temperature sensor on the remote controller (SW1-1) instead of the one on the indoor unit inlet thermistor.

Note 3. By setting SW3-1, SW1-7, and SW1-8 to a certain configuration, the fan can be set to remain stopped during cooling Thermo-OFF. See the table below for details.

Note 4. The settings that are configured from the remote controller will automatically be stored on the outdoor unit. The stored settings will automatically be restored when the indoor unit control board is replaced.

The switch setting may vary depending on the indoor unit's type. Refer to relevant Service Handbook for details.

## (2) Address switch

Actual indoor unit address setting varies in different systems. Refer to the installation manual for the outdoor unit for details on how to make the address setting.

Each address is set with a combination of the settings for the 10's digit and 1's digit. (Example)

When setting the address to "3", set the 1's digit to 3, and the 10's digit to 0. When setting the address to "25", set the 1's digit to 5, and the 10's digit to 2.

## 5-1-3 Remote Controller Switch Functions and Factory Settings

## (1) MA remote controller (PAR-20MAU)

The SW is located at the bottom of the remote controller under the cover. Operate the switches to perform the remote controller main/sub setting or other function settings. Normally, do not change the settings of switches other than the SW1 (main/ sub switching switch). (All the switches are set to "ON" at factory setting.)

|        4 | Suction temperature display  (discharge temperature display) | Displayed      | Not displayed       | When the suction temperature (discharge  temperature) display is not necessary,  set to "Not displayed".                                                                    | Before power on         |

The MA remote controller (PAR-21MAAU,PAR-30MAAU) does not have the switches listed above. Refer to the installation manual for the function setting.

## (2) ME remote controller (PAR-F27MEA-US)

Set the address of the remote controller with the rotary switch.

Example: In case of address 108

|                        | Address setting range   | Setting method                                                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main remote controller | 101-150                 | Add 100 to the smallest address of all the indoor units in the  same group. |
| Sub remote controller  | 151-200                 | Add 150 to the smallest address of all the indoor units in the  same group. |

| Setting of rotary switch   | Address No.                                                  |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 01-99 *1                   | 101-199 with the 100's digit automatically being set to 1 *2 |
| 00                         | 200                                                          |

- *1. At factory shipment, the rotary switch is set to 01.
- *2. The address range that can be set with the ME remote controller is between 101 and 200. When the dials are set to a number between 01 and 99, the 100's digit is automatically set to [1]. When the dials are set to 00, the 100's digit is automatically set to [2].

To set addresses, use a precision slotted screw driver [2.0 mm [0.08 in] (w)], and do not apply than 19.6N. The use of any other tool or applying too much load may damage the switch.

## 5-2 Outdoor Unit Control

## 5-2-1 Overview

-  The outdoor units are designated as OC and OS in the order of capacity from large to small (if two or more units have the same capacity, in the order of address from small to large).
-  The setting of outdoor unit can be verified by using the self-diagnosis switch (SW4).

| SW4 (SW6-10:OFF)      | Display                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ON 123 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 |   The unit is designated as the OC: "oc" appears on the display.   The unit is designated as OS: "oS" appears on the display.   For how to read the SW settings, refer to the following page(s). [9-1-1 How to  Read the LED](page 325) |

-  The OC determines the operation mode and the control mode, and it also communicates with the indoor units.
-  The OS exercises autonomous distributed control (over defrost, error detection, and actuator control etc.) according to the operation/control mode signals that are sent from the OC.

## 5-2-2 Rotation Control

-  At the initial startup, outdoor units start up in the order of "OC and OS." When the cumulative operation time of the OC reaches two hours, the OS will start up before the OC at the next start up.
-  Startup sequence rotation is performed while all the indoor units are stopped. (Even after two hours of operation, startup sequence rotation is not performed while the compressor is in operation.)
- In a system with multiple outdoor units (OC and OS), when the integrated operation time of the unit in operation (either OC or
- OS) reaches one hour during a cooling operation at low outside temperature, that unit will stop and the other unit will go into operation.
-  For information about rotation control at initial startup, refer to the following page(s). [5-2-14 Control at Initial Startup](page 131)
-  Performing startup sequence rotation does not change the basic operation of OC and OS. Only startup sequence is changed.  Startup sequence of the outdoor units can be checked with the self-diagnosis switch (SW4) on the OC.

## 5-2-3 Initial Control

-  When the power is turned on, the initial processing of the microcomputer is given top priority.
-  During the initial processing, control processing of the operation signal is suspended. (The control processing is resumed after the initial processing is completed. Initial processing involves data processing in the microcomputer and initial setting of each of the LEV opening. This process will take up to 5 minutes.)
-  During the initial processing, the LED monitor on the outdoor unit's control board displays S/W version → refrigerant type → Model and capacity → and communication address in turn every second.

## 5-2-4 Startup Control

-  The upper limit of frequency during the first 3 minutes of the operation is 50 Hz.
-  When the power is turned on, normal operation will start after the initial start-up mode (to be described later) has been completed (with a restriction on the frequency).

## 5-2-5 Refrigerant Bypass Control

## 5-2-6 Frequency Control

 Depending on the capacity required, the frequency of the compressor is controlled to keep constant evaporation temperature (0°C [32°F] = 0.71 MPa [103 psi]) during cooling operation, and condensing temperature (49°C [120°F] = 2.88 MPa [418 psi]) during heating operation.

-  The table below summarizes the operating frequency ranges of the inverter compressor during normal operation.
-  The OS in the multiple-outdoor-unit system operates at the actual compressor frequency value that is calculated by the OS based on the preliminary compressor frequency value that the OC determines.

| Model   | Frequency/cooling   | Frequency/cooling   | Frequency/heating   | Frequency/heating   |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Model   | Max                 | Min                 | Max                 | Min                 |
| HP72    | 50Hz                | 15Hz                | 103Hz               | 29Hz                |
| HP96    | 64Hz                | 15Hz                | 120Hz               | 29Hz                |

The maximum frequency during heating operation depends on the outside air temperature and the dipswitch settings.

## (1) Pressure limit

The upper limit of high pressure (63HS1) is preset, and when it exceeds the upper limit, the frequency is decreased every 15 seconds.

-  The actuation pressure is when the high-pressure reading on 63HS1 is 3.58MPa[519psi].

## (2) Discharge temperature limit

Discharge temperature (TH4) of the compressor in operation is monitored, and when it exceeds the upper limit, the frequency is decreased every minute.

-  Operating temperature is 115°C [239°F].

## (3) Periodic frequency control

Frequency control other than the ones performed at start-up, upon status change, and for protection is called periodic frequency control (convergent control) and is performed in the following manner.

## Periodic control cycle

Periodic control is performed after the following time has passed

-  30 seconds after either compressor start-up or the completion of defrost operation
-  seconds after frequency control based on discharge temperature or pressure limit

## The amount of frequency change

The amount of frequency change is controlled to approximate the target value based on the evaporation temperature (Te) and condensing temperature (Tc).

## 5-2-7 Defrost Operation Control

## (1) Starting the defrost operation

 The defrost cycle will start when all of the three conditions (outside temperature, cumulative compressor operation time, and pipe temperature) under <Condition 1>, <Condition 2>, or <Condition 3> are met.

## 5-2-9 Refrigerant Recovery Control

Refrigerant recovery is performed for each BC port during heating operation to prevent the refrigerant from accumulating inside the units that are stopped (in the fan mode), in the cooling mode, or in the heating Thermo-OFF mode. It is also performed during cooling operation to prevent an excessive amount of refrigerant from accumulating in the outdoor heat exchanger.

## Starting criteria for the refrigerant recovery cycle (during Cooling-only, Cooling-main, Heating-only, or Heating-main mode)

The refrigerant recovery mode starts when all of the following conditions are met:

- 1) When 5 minutes have passed in the Heating-only or Heating-main mode or 30 seconds have passed in the Cooling-only or Cooling-main mode since the completion of the previous refrigerant recovery cycle AND the when following conditions are met.

TH4 > 105°C [221°F]

- 2) When the port is not in the 4-minute restart delay mode

## Starting criteria for the refrigerant recovery cycle (during Cooling-only, Cooling-main, Heating-only, or Heating-main mode)

- 1) When the port is in the cooling Thermo-OFF, fan, or stop mode SVC at the port turns on for 30 seconds.
- 2) The opening of LEV1 and LEV3 is increased.

## 5-2-10 Oil recovery during compressor operation at low frequency

-  Oil collection operation is performed after units have been operated continuously for an extended period at the compressor frequency F as listed in the table below (Condition 1). It is performed by fixing the compressor frequency F to the value listed below (Condition 2) for a maximum of four minutes.
-  The opening of the LEV on indoor units will increase during oil collection operation.

## 5-2-11 Outdoor Unit Fan Control

## (1) Control method

-  Depending on the capacity required, the rotation speed of the outdoor unit fan is controlled by the inverter to keep a constant condensing temperature of (outside temperature +10°C [50°F]) during cooling operation and a constant evaporation temperature of (0°C [32°F] =0.71 <Pa [103psi]) during heating operation.
-  The OS in the multiple-outdoor-unit system operates at the actual outdoor unit fan control value that is calculated by the OS based on the preliminary outdoor unit fan control value that the OC determines.

## (2) Control

-  Outdoor unit fan stops while the compressor is stopped (except in the presence of input from snow sensor).
-  The fan operates at full speed for 5 seconds after start-up.(Only when TH7<0°C [32°F])
-  The outdoor unit fan stops during defrost operation.

## 5-2-12 Compressor discharge superheat control (expansion valve <LEV4>)

-  Compressor discharge superheat of OC and OS is controlled separately.

 Compressor discharge superheat (calculated based on the compressor discharge temperature (TH4) and high pressure (63HS)) is controlled by LEV4 every 30 seconds to stay within the certain target ranges that corresponds to given compressor frequencies.

| Compressor frequency   | Target compressor discharge superheat   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 93 Hz or above         | 20°C [36°F]                             |
| 83 - 92Hz              | 25°C [45°F]                             |
| 72 - 82Hz              | 30°C [54°F]                             |
| 71 Hz or below         | 40°C [72°F]                             |

## 5-2-13 Evaporation Temperature Control (Expansion Valves <LEV5a>)

## (1) LEV5 control will begin when all of the following conditions are met.

-  Units are operated in the Heating-Only or Heating-Main mode.
-  TH7<5°C [41°F]
-  63LS<0.69MPa [99psi]

- 1) If an attempt is made to put into operation a group of indoor units whose total capacity exceeds the maximum allowable capacity, some of the indoor units will go into the same condition as Thermo-OFF.

## (2) Ending the emergency operation

- 1) End conditions
- When one of the following conditions is met, emergency operation stops, and the unit makes an error stop.
-  When the integrated operation time of compressor in cooling mode has reached four hours.
-  When the integrated operation time of compressor in heating mode has reached two hours.
-  When an error is detected that does not permit the unit to perform an emergency operation.
- 2) Control at or after the completion of emergency operation
-  At or after the completion of emergency operation, the compressor stops, and the error code reappears on the remote controller.
-  If another error reset is performed at the completion of an emergency mode, the unit repeats the procedures in section (1) above.
-  To stop the emergency mode and perform a current-carrying operation after correcting the error, perform a power reset.
- 2. Communication circuit failure or when some of the outdoor units are turned off
- This is a temporary operation mode in which the outdoor unit that is not in trouble operates when communication circuit failure occurs or when some of the outdoor units are turned off.

## (1) Starting the emergency operation (When the OC is in trouble)

- 1) When an error occurs, the error source and the error code appear on the display on the remote controller.
- 2) Reset the error via the remote controller to start an emergency operation.

## Precautions before servicing the unit

-  When the OC is in trouble, the OS temporarily takes over the OC's function and performs an emergency operation. When this happens, the indoor unit connection information are changed.
-  In a system that has a billing function, a message indicating that the billing system information has an error may appear on the TG-2000A. Even if this message appears, do not change (or set) the refrigerant system information on the TG-2000A. After the completion of an emergency operation, the correct connection information will be restored.

## (2) Starting the emergency operation (When the OS is in trouble)

- 1) A communication error occurs. -> An emergency operation starts in approximately six minutes.

## Error codes that permit an emergency operation (Applicable to both OC and OS)

| Trouble source                     |   Error codes that permit an  emergency operation | Error code description   |

## 5-4 Operation Flowcharts

## 5-4-1 Operation Sequence Flowchart

- (1) Indoor unit (cooling, heating, dry, fan mode)

<!-- image -->

- *Note 1. Indoor unit LEV fully closed : Opening 41.
- *Note 2. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit side or the BC controller or outdoor unit side. If some of the indoor units are experiencing a problem, only those indoor units that are experiencing the problem will stop. If the BC controller or the outdoor unit is experiencing a problem, all the connected units will stop.
- *Note 3. If multiple indoor units are connected to a port and there is a discrepancy in the operation mode between the indoor unit and the port, the operation will be prohibited. (Operation mode blinks on the remote controller, the Fan stops, indoor unit LEV becomes fully closed.)

## (2) Outdoor unit (cooling only, heating only, cooling main and heating main modes)

<!-- image -->

- *Note 1. For about 3 minutes after power on, search for the indoor unit address, for the remote controller address, and for the group information will start. During this, "HO"/ "PLEASE WAIT" blinks on the display of the remote controller. When the indoor unit to be controlled by the remote controller is missing, "HO"/ "PLEASE WAIT" keeps blinking on the display of the remote controller even after 3 or more minutes after power on.

*Note 2. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit or the outdoor unit side. The outdoor stops only when all of the connected indoor units are experiencing problems. The operation of even a single indoor unit will keep the outdoor unit running. The error will be indicated on the LED display.

- *Note 3. The units will follow the operation mode commands from the BC controller
- *Note 4. When the operation mode commands from the BC controllers are mixed (both cooling and heating), the actual operation mode is determined by the outdoor unit.

Control

## (3) BC controller (cooling only, heating only, cooling main and heating main modes)

Note 1. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit side or the BC controller or outdoor unit side. If some of the indoor units are experiencing a problem, only those indoor units that are experiencing the problem will stop. If the BC controller or the outdoor unit is experiencing a problem, all the connected units will stop.

<!-- image -->

## 5-4-2 Actions Performed in Different Modes

## (1) Cooling operation

*Note 1. The indoor fan operates at the set notch under cooling mode regardless of the ON/OFF state of the thermostat.

<!-- image -->

## (2) Heating operation

<!-- image -->

- 1) When the outdoor unit goes into the defrost mode, defrost command is sent to the BC controller and indoor units. Upon reception of the command, the indoor units will go into the defrost mode. When defrosting is completed and upon receiving the signal that indicates the completion of defrosting, indoor units will resume the heating operation.
- 2) Defrost end condition: 10 minutes have passed since defrost operation started. Outdoor unit pipe temperature: Refer to the following page(s).[5-2-7 Defrost Operation Control](page 127)

## (3) Dry operation

<!-- image -->

*Note 1.When the indoor unit inlet temperature exceeds 18 C [64 F], the outdoor unit (compressor) and the indoor unit fan start the intermittent operation simultaneously. When the indoor unit inlet temperature becomes 18 C [64 F],or less, the fan always runs (at low speed). The outdoor unit, the indoor unit, and the solenoid valve operate in the same way as they do in the cooling operation when the compressor is turned on.

*Note 2.Thermostat is always kept on during test run mode, and indoor and outdoor unit intermittent operation (ON) time is a little longer than that of normal operation.

## 6 TestRun 6-1 Read before Test Run

- (1) Check for refrigerant leak and loose cables and connectors.

## (2) When opening or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact with any of the internal components.

-  Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes, and confirm that the capacitor voltage (inverter main circuit) has dropped to 20 VDC or less. (It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turned off.)
-  Control box houses high temperature parts. Be well careful even after turning off the power source.
-  Perform the service after disconnecting the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) and the inverter board connector (CN1). (To plug or unplugconnectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.)
-  To connect wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.
-  Reconnect the connector (CNINV) back to the fan board and reconnect the connector (CN1) back to the inverter board after servicing.

## (3) Measure the insulation resistance between the power supply terminal block and the ground with a 500V megger and make sure it reads at least 1.0Mohm.

-  Do not operate the unit if the insulation resistance is below 1.0Mohm.
-  Do not apply megger voltage to the terminal block for transmission line. Doing so will damage the controller board.
-  The insulation resistance between the power supply terminal block and the ground could go down to close to 1Mohm immediately after installation or when the power is kept off for an extended period of time because of the accumulation of refrigerant in the compressor.
-  If insulation resistance reads at least 1 M Ω , by turning on the main power and keeping it on for at least 12 hours, the refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate and the insulation resistance will go up.
-  Do not measure the insulation resistance of the terminal block for transmission line for the unit remote controller.

## (4) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating.

-  Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor.
-  Check the compressor for a ground fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. (The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.)

## (5) Make sure the valves on both the high-pressure and low-pressure sides are fully open.

Securely tighten the cap.

## (6) Check the phase sequence and the voltage of the power supply.

When the voltage is out of the ±10% range, or when the phase voltage difference is more than 2%, please discuss the countermeasure with the customer.

## (7) [When a transmission booster is connected]

Turn on the transmission booster before turning on the outdoor units.

 If the outdoor units are turned on first, the connection information for the refrigerant circuit may not be properly recognized.  In case the outdoor units are turned on before the transmission booster is turned on, perform a power reset on the outdoor units after turning on the power booster.

## (8) Turn on the main power at least 12 hours before test run.

Insufficient powering time may result in compressor damage.

## (9) When a power supply unit is connected to the transmission line for centralized control(*), perform a test run with the power supply unit being energized. Leave the power jumper connector on CN41 as it is (factory setting).

*Includes the cases where power is supplied to the transmission line from a system controller with a power-supply function

## 6-8 Operation Characteristics and Refrigerant Charge

It is important to have a clear understanding of the characteristics of refrigerant and the operating characteristics of air conditioners before attempting to adjust the refrigerant amount in a given system.

- The following table shows items of particular importance.
- 1) During cooling operation, the amount of refrigerant in the accumulator is the smallest when all indoor units are in operation.
- 2) During heating operation, the amount of refrigerant in the accumulator is the largest when all indoor units are in operation.
- 3) General tendency of discharge temperature
-  Discharge temperature tends to rise when the system is short on refrigerant.
-  Changing the amount of refrigerant in the system while there is refrigerant in the accumulator has little effect on the discharge temperature.
-  The higher the pressure, the more likely it is for the discharge temperature to rise.
-  The lower the pressure, the more likely it is for the discharge temperature to rise.
- 4) When the amount of refrigerant in the system is adequate, the compressor shell temperature is 10 to 60°C [18 to 108°F] higher than the low pressure saturation temperature (Te).
- -> If the temperature difference between the compressor shell temperature and low pressure saturation temperature (Te) is smaller than 5°C [9°F], an overcharging of refrigerant is suspected.

## 6-9 Evaluating and Adjusting Refrigerant Charge

## 6-9-1 Refrigerant Overcharge and undercharge

Overcharging or undercharging of refrigerant can cause the following symptoms:

Before attempting to adjust the amount of refrigerant in the system, thoroughly check the operating conditions of the system. Then, adjust the refrigerant amount by running the unit in the refrigerant amount adjust mode.

| The system comes to an abnormal stop, displaying 1500 (overcharged refrigerant) on  the controller.         | Overcharged refrigerant         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| The operating frequency does not reach the set frequency, and there is a problem with  performance.         | Insufficient refrigerant amount |
| The system comes to an abnormal stop, displaying 1102 (abnormal discharge temper- ature) on the controller. | Insufficient refrigerant amount |

## 6-9-2 Checking the Refrigerant Charge during Operation

Operate all indoor units in either cooling-only or heating-only mode, and check such items as discharge temperature, subcooling, low pressure, suction temperature, and shell bottom temperature to estimate the amount of refrigerant in the system.

| Symptoms                                                                                                                                                                                  | Conclusion                          |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Discharge temperature is high. (Normal discharge temperature is below 95°C [203°F].)                                                                                                      | Slightly under- charged refrigerant |

| Suction superheat is large. (Normal suction superheat is less than 20°C [36°F].)                                                                                                          | Slightly under- charged refrigerant |
| Compressor shell bottom temperature is high. (The difference between the compressor shell  bottom temperature and low pressure saturation temperature (Te) is greater than 60°C [108°F].) | Slightly under- charged refrigerant |
| Discharge superheat is small. (Normal discharge superheat is greater than 10°C [18°F].)                                                                                                   | Slightly overcharged  refrigerant   |
| Compressor shell bottom temperature is low. (The difference between the compressor shell bot- tom temperature and low pressure saturation temperature (Te) is less than 5°C [9°F].)       | Slightly overcharged  refrigerant   |

## 6-9-3 The Amount of Refrigerant to Be Added

The amount of refrigerant that is shown in the table below is factory-charged to the outdoor units. The amount necessary for extended pipe (field piping) is not included and must be added on site.

| Outdoor unit model                                             | HP72   | HP96   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Amount of pre-charged refrigerant in the outdoor unit (kg)     | 11.8   | 11.8   |
| Amount of pre-charged refrigerant in the outdoor unit [lbs-oz] | 26-1   | 26-1   |

## (1) Calculation formula

A = 40m [131ft]

19.05

F+G = 4m [13ft]

9.52

B+C+D+E+a+b+f = 60m [196ft]

6.35

c+d+e = 20m [65ft]

The piping length between the outdoor unit and the farthest indoor unit F + A + C + D + e = 73 meters [239ft], which is longer than 30.5 m [100 ft].

Therefore,

The amount of refrigerant to be charged [kg]=40×0.21+4×0.14+60×0.054+20×0.021+6+2+5+2=27.7 kg

The amount of refrigerant to be charged [oz]=131×2.26+13×1.51+196×0.59+65×0.23+212+71+177+71=978 oz

## 6-9-4 Refrigerant Charge Adjustment Mode

Follow the procedures below to add or extract refrigerant as necessary depending on the operation mode.

When the function switch (SW4 (922)) on the main board on the outdoor unit (OC only) is turned to ON, the unit goes into the refrigerant amount adjust mode, and the following sequence is followed.

The unit will not go into the refrigerant amount adjust mode when the switch on the OS is set to ON.

## Operation

When the unit is in the refrigerant amount adjust mode, the LEV on the indoor unit does not open as fully as it normally does during cooling operation to secure subcooling.

- 1) Adjust the refrigerant amount based on the values of TH4, SC11, SC16, and Tc, following the flowchart below. The TH4, SC11, SC16, and Tc values can be displayed by using the self-diagnosis switch (SW4 (SW6-10: OFF)) on the control board of the OC or OS.
- 2) There may be cases when the refrigerant amount may seem adequate for a short while after starting the unit in the refrigerant amount adjust mode but turn out to be inadequate later on (when the refrigerant system stabilizes).

## When the amount of refrigerant is truly adequate.

Subcool (SC11 and SC16) of the BC controller is 5°C [9°F] or above and SH on the indoor unit is between 5 and 15°C [9 and 27°F].

## The refrigerant amount may seem adequate at the moment, but may turn out to be inadequate later on.

Subcool (SC11 and SC16) of the BC controller is 5°C [9°F] or less and SH on the indoor unit is 5°C [9°F] or less. Wait until the Subcool (SC11 and SC16) of the BC controller reaches 5°C [9°F] or above and the SH of the indoor unit is between 5 and 15°C [9 and 27°F] to determine that the refrigerant amount is adequate.

 SC11: Subcool of liquid refrigerant at BC controller inlet; SC16: Subcool of liquid refrigerant at BC controller outlet

- 3) High pressure must be at least 2.0MPa [290psi] to enable a proper adjustment of refrigerant amount to be made.
- 4) Refrigerant amount adjust mode automatically ends 90 minutes after beginning. When this happens, by turning off the SW4 (922) and turning them back on, the unit will go back into the refrigerant amount adjust mode.

## CAUTION

Do not release the extracted refrigerant into the air.

## CAUTION

Charge liquid refrigerant (as opposed to gaseous refrigerant) into the system.

-  If gaseous refrigerant is charged into the system, the composition of the refrigerant in the cylinder will change and may result in performance loss.

| Outdoor unit, indoor unit, or  BC controller makes noise  when the operation mode is  switched between Cooling  and Heating.      | Normal display                                      | This noise is made when the refrigerant circuit is reversed and is normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Sound of the refrigerant flow is  heard from the indoor unit im- mediately after starting opera- tion.                            | Normal display                                      | This is caused by the transient instability of the refrigerant flow and is nor- mal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Warm air sometimes comes  out of the indoor units that are  not in the heating mode.                                              | Normal display                                      | This is due to the fact that the LEVs on some of the indoor units are kept  slightly open to prevent the refrigerant in the indoor units that are not op- erating in the heating mode from liquefying and accumulating in the com- pressor. It is part of a normal operation.                                                     |

## 7-4-3 Error Code [2502] (Models with a drain sensor)

## 1. Error code definition

Drain pump fault

## 2. Error definition and error detection method

- 1) Make the drain sensor thermistor self-heat. If the temperature rise is small, it is interpreted that the sensor is immersed in water. This condition is considered to be a preliminary error, and the unit goes into the 3-minute restart delay mode.
- 2) If another episode of the above condition is detected during the preliminary error, this is considered a drain pump error, and "2502" appears on the monitor.
- 3) This error is always detected while the drain pump is in operation.
- 4) The following criteria are met when the criteria for the forced stoppage of outdoor unit (system stoppage) are met.
- ∗ "Liquid pipe temperature - inlet temperature -10°C [ -18 °F] " has been detected for 30 minutes.
- The immersion of drain sensor is detected 10 consecutive times.
- ∗ The conditions that are listed under items 1) through 3) above are always met before the criteria for the forced stoppage of the outdoor unit.

## 7-8-16 Error Code [6608]

## 1. Error code definition

No response error

## 2. Error definition and error detection method

-  When no response command is returned although acknowledgement (ACK) is received after transmission, an error is detected.
-  When the data is transmitted 10 times in a row with 3 seconds interval, an error is detected on the transmission side.

The address/attribute appeared on the display on the remote controller indicates the controller where an error occurred.

## 3. Cause

- 1) The transmission line work is performed while the power is on, the transmitted data will collide, and the wave shape will be changed.
- 2) The transmission is sent and received repeatedly due to noise.
- 3) Decrease of transmission line voltage/signal by exceeding acceptable range of transmission wiring.
- Farthest:200m [656ft] or less

Remote controller wiring:12m [39ft] or less

- 4) The transmission line voltage/signal is decreased due to erroneous sizing of transmission line.

## 4. Check method and remedy

- 1) When an error occurs during commissioning, turn off the power sources for the outdoor unit, indoor unit, BC controller, and LOSSNAY for 5 or more minutes, and then turn them on again.
-  When they return to normal operation, the cause of the error is the transmission line work performed with the power on.  If an error occurs again, check the cause 2).
- 2) Check 3) and 4) above.
-  If the cause is found, correct it.
-  If no cause is found, check 3).
- (1) Check the transmission waveform, and check the transmission line for electrical noise. For details, refer to the following page(s). [8-4 Checking Transmission Waveform and for Electrical Noise Interference](page 264)

## 8-2 ME remote Controller Problems

## 8-2-1 The LCD Does Not Light Up.

## 1. Phenomena

Even if the operation button on the remote controller is pressed, the display remains unlit and the unit does not start running. (Power indicator does not appear on the screen.)

## 2. Cause

- 1) The power for the M-NET transmission line is not supplied from the outdoor unit.
- 2) Short circuit of the transmission line.
- 3) Incorrect wiring of the M-NET transmission line on the outdoor unit.
-  Disconnected wire for the MA remote controller or disconnected line to the terminal block.
-  The indoor transmission line is connected incorrectly to the transmission terminal block for centralized controller (TB7).
- 4) Disconnected transmission line on the remote controller.
- 5) Remote controller failure
- 6) Outdoor unit failure (For details, refer to the following page(s). [8-18 Troubleshooting Problems Using the LED Status Indicators on the Outdoor Unit](page 322))

## 3. Check method and remedy

- 1) Check voltage of the transmission terminal block for of the ME remote controller.
-  If voltage between is 17V and 30V → ME remote controller failure
-  When voltage is 17V or less → For details, refer to the following page(s).
- [8-12-2 Troubleshooting Problems with Outdoor Unit Transmission Power Supply Circuit](page 308)
- [8-13-2 Troubleshooting Problems with Outdoor Unit Transmission Power Supply Circuit](page 310)
- 2) When 2) and 3) above apply, check code 7102 will be displayed on the self-diagnosis LED.

## 8-2-2 The LCD Momentarily Lights Up and Then Goes Off.

## 1. Phenomena

When the remote controller operation SW is turned on, a temporary operation display is indicated, and the display lights out immediately.

## 2. Cause

- 1) The power is not supplied to the indoor unit.
-  The main power of the indoor unit (AC208/230V) is not on.
-  The connector on the indoor unit board has come off.
-  The fuse on the indoor unit board has melted.
-  Transformer failure and disconnected wire of the indoor unit
-  The indoor unit board failure
- 2) The outdoor control board failure As the indoor unit does not interact with the outdoor unit, the outdoor unit model cannot be recognized.

## 3. Check method and remedy

- *1. Refer to the parts catalog "transformer check".

## 8-2-3 "HO" Does Not Go Off the Screen.

## 1. Phenomena

"HO" display on the remote controller does not disappear, and no operation is performed even if the button is pressed.

## 2. Cause

## Without using MELANS

- 1) Outdoor unit address is set to "00"
- 2) A wrong address is set.
-  The address of the indoor unit that is connected to the remote controller is incorrect. (It should equal the ME remote controller address plus 100.)
-  A wrong address is set to the ME remote controller. (100 must be added to the address of the indoor unit.)
- 3) Faulty wiring of the terminal block for transmission line (TB5) of the indoor unit in the same group with the remote controller.
- 4) The centralized control switch (SW5-1) on the outdoor unit is set to ON.
- 5) Disconnection or faulty wiring of indoor unit transmission line.
- 6) Disconnection between the terminal block for M-NET line connection (TB5) of the indoor unit and the male connector (CN2M)
- 7) The male power supply connectors on 2 or more outdoor units are connected to the female power supply switch connector (CN40) for the transmission line for centralized control.
- 8) Outdoor unit control board failure
- 9) Indoor unit control board failure
- 10) Remote controller failure

## Interlocking control with MELANS

- 1) No group registration is made using MELANS. (The indoor unit and the ME remote controller are not grouped.)
- 2) Disconnected transmission line for centralized control (TB7) of the outdoor unit
- 3) The male power supply connector is connected to CN40 on more than one outdoor unit, or the connector is connected to CN40 on the outdoor unit in the system to which a power supply unit for transmission line is connected.

## Using MELANS

- 1) When MELANS is used, "HO" display on the remote controller will disappear when the indoor unit and the local remote controller (ME remote controller) are grouped.
- If "HO" does not disappear after the registration, check items 1) through 3) in the "Cause" column of the section on interlocked control with MELANS.

## 3. Check method and remedy

<!-- image -->

- *1. When the indoor unit address is set to 1 - 50, the address will be forcibly set to 100.

## 8-2-4 "88" Appears on the LCD.

## 1. Phenomena

"88" appears on the remote controller when the address is registered or confirmed.

## 8-4 Checking Transmission Waveform and for Electrical Noise Interference

## 8-4-1 M-NET

Control is performed by exchanging signals between the outdoor unit and the indoor unit (ME remote controller) through MNET transmission. Noise interference on the transmission line will interrupt the normal transmission, leading to erroneous operation.

## (1) Symptoms caused by noise interference on the transmission line

| Cause                                        | Erroneous operation                                                                                                                 | Error code   | Error code definition                     |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Noise interference on  the transmission line | Signal is transformed and will be misjudged as the  signal of another address.                                                      | 6600         | Address overlap                           |

| Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission wave pattern is transformed due to  the noise, and will not be received normally leading  to no acknowledgement (ACK). | 6607         | No ACK error                              |
| Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission cannot be performed due to the fine  noise.                                                                            | 6603         | Transmission line  bus busy error         |
| Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission is successful; however, the acknowl- edgement (ACK) or the response cannot be re- ceived normally due to the noise.    | 6607 6608    | No ACK error No response error            |

## (2) Wave shape check

<!-- image -->

## Wave shape check

Check the wave pattern of the transmission line with an oscilloscope. The following conditions must be met.

- 1) Small wave pattern (noise) must not exist on the transmission signal. (Minute noise (approximately 1V) can be generated by DC-DC converter or the inverter operation; however, such noise is not a problem when the shield of the transmission line is grounded.)
- 2) The sectional voltage level of transmission signal should be as follows.

|   Logic | Voltage level of the transmission line   |
|---------|------------------------------------------|
|       0 | V$\_{HL}$ = 2.5V or higher                |
|       1 | V$\_{BN}$ = 1.3V or below                 |

-  When a valve malfunctions, check if the wrong solenoid valve coil is not attached the lead wire of the coil is not disconnected, the connector on the board is not inserted wrongly, or the wire for the connector is not disconnected.

## (1) In case of 21S4a (4-way switching valve)

About this 4-way valve When not powered: Conducts electricity between the oil separator outlet and heat exchanger AND the gas ball valve (BV1) and the accumulator to complete the circuit for the cooling cycle. When powered: The electricity runs between the oil separator and the gas ball valve, and between the heat exchanger and the accumulator. This circulation is for heating.

Check the LED display and the intake and the discharge temperature for the 4-way valve to check whether the valve has no faults and the electricity runs between where and where.Do not touch the pipe when checking the temperature, as the pipe on the oil separator side will be hot.

Do not give an impact from outside, as the outer hull will be deformed leading to the malfunction of the inner valve.

## (2) In case of SV1a (Bypass valve)

This solenoid valve opens when powered (Relay ON).

- 1) At compressor start-up, the SV1a turns on for 4 minutes, and the operation can be checked by the self-diagnosis LED display and the closing sound.
- 2) To check whether the valve is open or closed, check the change of the SV1a downstream piping temperature while the valve is being powered.Even when the valve is closed, high-temperature refrigerant flows inside the capillary next to the valve. (Therefore, temperature of the downstream piping will not be low with the valve closed.)

## (3) SV4a, 4b, and 4d (HP72, HP96 models)(Controls heat exchanger capacity)

- 1) Depending on the conditions during Cooling-only operation, at least one of the solenoid valves among SV4a through 4d turns on. Check for proper operation on the LED and by listening for the operation sound of the solenoid valve.
- 2) During Heating-only operation, SV4a through 4d all turn on. Check for proper operation on the LED and by listening for the operation sound of the solenoid valves.
- 3) Depending on the conditions during Cooling-main or Heating-main operation, at least one of the solenoid valves among SV4a through 4d turns on. Check for proper operation on the LED and by listening for the operation sound of the solenoid valve.
- 4) The diagram on the next page shows the refrigerant flow. This diagram shows the flow of the high-temperature (high-pressure) gas refrigerant in the Cooling-only and Cooling-main modes and the flow of the low-temperature gas/liquid refrigerant in the Heating-only and Heating-main modes. Refer to the refrigerant circuit diagram. Solenoid valves turns on and off according to such factors as the capacity of the indoor units in operation and outside temperature. Check the LED. Remove the SV coil, open the lid, and check the plunger. The type of pin face wrench that is listed in the service parts list is required to perform this task.

## (4) In the case of SV5b (Bypass valve)

This solenoid valve closes when energized (when the relay is on).

This valve turns off for three minutes after the completion of the defrost cycle, or when SV9 is on turned ON and the value of 63HS1 is greater than 3.5 MPa [507psi] during Heating-only or Heating-main operation at the minimum frequency. The valve position can be determined by measuring and monitoring the changes in the pipe temperature on the downstream of SV5b while the unit is de-energized. When the valve is open, high-temperature gas refrigerant passes through the pipe. Do not attempt to check the pipe temperature by touching the pipe.

## (5) In the case of SV9 (Bypass valve)

This solenoid valve opens when energized (when the relay is on)

This valve turns on when the value of 63HS1 is greater than 3.5 MPa [507psi] during Heating-only or Heating-main operation at the minimum frequency. The valve position can be determined by measuring and monitoring the changes in the pipe temperature on the downstream of SV9 while the unit is energized. When the valve is open, high-temperature gas refrigerant passes through the pipe. Do not attempt to check the pipe temperature by touching the pipe.

## (6) In the case of SV10

This solenoid valve opens when energized (when the relay is on) The valve opens during the On-defrost cycle. The valve position can be determined by measuring and monitoring the changes in the pipe temperature on the downstream of SV10 while the unit is energized. When the valve is open, high-temperature gas refrigerant passes through the pipe. Do not attempt to check the pipe temperature by touching the pipe.

## (7) In the case of SV11

This solenoid valve opens when energized (when the relay is on)

The valve opens during the On-defrost cycle. The valve position can be determined by measuring and monitoring the changes in the pipe temperature on the downstream of SV11 while the unit is energized. When the valve is open, high-temperature gas refrigerant passes through the pipe. Do not attempt to check the pipe temperature by touching the pipe.

## 8-7 Troubleshooting Outdoor Unit Fan Problems

## (1) Fan motor (common items)

-  To check the revolution of the fan, check the inverter output state on the self-diagnosis LED, as the inverter on the outdoor fan controls the revolutions of the fan.The revolution of the fan is approximately 680 rpm (HP72 model), 790 rpm (HP96 model) at full speed.
-  When starting the fan, the fan runs at full speed for 5 seconds.
-  When setting the DIP SW4 (when SW6-10 is set to OFF) as shown in the figure below, the inverter output [%] will appear. 100% indicates the full speed and 0% indicates the stopping.

<!-- image -->

-  For how to read the SW settings, refer to the following page(s). [9-1-1 How to Read the LED](page 325)
-  As the revolution of the fan changes under control, at the interphase or when the indoor unit operation capacity is low, the revolution of the fan may change.
-  If the fan does not move or it vibrates, Fan board problem or fan motor problem is suspected. When checking the fan motor for problems by shutting down the power, be sure to disconnect the motor wire from the fan board. If a short-circuited fan board malfunctions, it will keep the fan motor from rotating smoothly. For details, refer to the following page(s).

## 8-8 Troubleshooting LEV Problems

## 8-8-1 General Overview on LEV Operation

## LEV operation

LEV are stepping-motor-driven valves that operate by receiving the pulse signals from the indoor and outdoor unit control boards.

## (1) Outdoor LEV (LEV5a, LEV4), Indoor LEV and BC controller LEV

The valve opening changes according to the number of pulses.

- 1) Control boards and the LEV (Indoor unit LEV, and BC controller LEV1 (G type only) and LEV3)

Outdoor control board

Note. The connector numbers on the intermediate connector and the connector on the control board differ. Check the color of the lead wire to judge the number.

<!-- image -->

- 2) Control boards and the LEV (BC controller LEV1 (Applicable only to the GA and HA types.))

<!-- image -->

## 3) Pulse signal output and valve operation

| Output  (phase)  number   | Output state   | Output state   | Output state   | Output state   |
|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Output  (phase)  number   | 1              | 2              | 3              | 4              |
| 1                         |                |                |                | ON OFF OFF ON  |
| 2                         |                |                |                | ON ON OFF OFF  |
| 3                         |                |                |                | OFF ON ON OFF  |
| 4                         |                |                |                | OFF OFF ON ON  |

Output pulses change in the following orders when the

Valve is closed; 1 2 3 4 1 Valve is open; 4 3 2 1 4

- *1. When the LEV opening angle does not change, all the output phases will be off.
- *2. When the output is open phase or remains ON, the motor cannot run smoothly, and rattles and vibrates.

## 4) LEV valve closing and opening operation

*When the power is turned on, the valve closing signal of 2200 pulses will be output from the indoor board to LEV to fix the valve position. It must be fixed at point A.

When the valve operates smoothly, no sound from LEV or no vibration occurs, however, when the pulses change from E to A in the chart or the valve is locked, a big sound occurs.

*Whether a sound is generated or not can be determined by holding a screwdriver against it, then placing your ear against the handle.

- 2) Check method of fully open state or fully closed state of LEV

 Check LEV opening (pulse) on the self-diagnosis LED (Outdoor control board SW1).

Full open: 2000 pulses

- Fully closed: 110 pulses (In the case of heating-only mode, however, the pulse may become 110 or more.)
-  When LEV is fully open, measure the temperature at the upstream and downstream pipes of LEV, and make sure that there is no temperature difference. When LEV is fully closed, check that there is no refrigerant flowing sound.
-  When LEV is fully closed, check that there is no refrigerant flowing sound.
- 3) Refer to the chart below to judge LEV opening controlled by the values of the differential pressure and of the superheat. (BC controller LEV basic operation characteristic)

## 8-10 Troubleshooting Inverter Problems (TKMU)

## 8-10-1 Inverter-Related Problems and Solutions

-  Replace only the compressor if only the compressor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent will flow through the inverter if the compressor is damaged, however, the power supply is automatically cut when overcurrent is detected, protecting the inverter from damage.)
-  Replace only the fan motor if only the fan motor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent will flow through the inverter if the fan motor is damaged, however, the power supply is automatically cut when overcurrrent is detected, protecting the inverter from damage.)
-  Replace the defective components if the inverter is found to be defective.
-  If both the compressor and the inverter are found to be defective, replace the defective component(s) of both devices.

## (1) Inverter-related problems: Troubleshooting and remedies

- 1) The INV board has a large-capacity electrolytic capacitor, in which residual voltage remains even after the main power is turned off, posing a risk of electric shock. Before inspecting the inverter-related items, turn off the main power, wait for 5 to 10 minutes, and confirm that the voltage at both ends of the electrolytic capacitor has dropped to a sufficiently low level.
- 2) Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. (To plug or unplugconnectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.)
- 3) To connect wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.
- 4) Reconnect the connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.
- 5) The IPM on the inverter becomes damaged if there are loose screws are connectors. If a problem occurs after replacing some of the parts, mixed up wiring is often the cause of the problem. Check for proper connection of the wiring, screws, connectors, and Faston terminals.
- 6) To avoid damage to the circuit board, do not connect or disconnect the inverter-related connectors with the main power turned on.
- 7) Current sensors become damaged if electricity is passed through without them being connected to the circuit board. Connect the current sensor to the appropriate connectors on the circuit board before operating the inverter.
- 8) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the terminals are securely locked in place after insertion.

Press the tab on the terminals to remove them.

<!-- image -->

- 9) When the IPM, diode stack, or IGBT is replaced, apply a thin layer of heat radiation grease that is supplied evenly to these parts. Wipe off any grease that may get on the wiring terminal to avoid terminal contact failure.
- 10) Faulty wiring to the compressor damages the compressor. Connect the wiring in the correct phase sequence.
- 11) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. (The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.)

The insulation resistance could go down to close to 1M Ω after installation or when the power is kept off for an extended period of time because of the accumulation of refrigerant in the compressor. If the earth leakage breaker is triggered, please use the following procedure to take care of this.

-  Disconnect the wires from the compressor's terminal block.
-  If the resistance is less than 1 M Ω , switch on the power for the outdoor unit with the wires still disconnected.
-  Leave the power on for at least 12 hours.
-  Check that the resistance has recovered to 1 M Ω or greater.

## Earth leakage current measurement method

 For easy on-site measurement of the earth leakage current, enable the filter with a measurement instrument that has filter functions as below, clamp all the power supply wires, and measure.

Recommended measurement instrument: CLAMP ON LEAK HiTESTER 3283 made by HIOKI E.E. CORPORATION  When measuring one device alone, measure near the device's power supply terminal block.

## 8-10-13 Simple Check on Inverter Circuit Components

-  Turn off the power of the unit and leave it turned off for 10 minutes. Check that the voltage of the electrolytic capacitor (inverter main circuit) is 20 VDC or below. Then, remove the relevant parts from the control box.  Before checking, turn the power off and remove the parts to be checked from the control box.

## 8-10-14 Troubleshooting Problems with Intelligent Power Module

Measure resistances between each pair of terminals on the IPM with a tester, and use the results for troubleshooting.

- 1) Notes on measurement
-  Check the polarity before measuring. (On the tester, black normally indicates plus.)
-  Check that the resistance is not open ( Ω ) or not shorted (to 0 Ω ).
-  The values are for reference, and the margin of errors is allowed.
-  The result that is more than double or half of the result that is measured at the same measurement point is not allowed.
- 2) Tester restriction
-  Use the tester whose internal electrical power source is 1.5V or greater
-  Use the dry-battery-powered tester.

(The accurate diode-specific resistance cannot be measured with the button-battery-powered card tester, as the applied voltage is low.)

-  Use a low-range tester if possible. A more accurate resistance can be measured.

## 8-11 Troubleshooting Inverter Problems (YKMU)

## 8-11-1 Inverter-Related Problems and Solutions

-  Replace only the compressor if only the compressor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent will flow through the inverter if the compressor is damaged, however, the power supply is automatically cut when overcurrent is detected, protecting the inverter from damage.)
-  Replace only the fan motor if only the fan motor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent will flow through the inverter if the fan motor is damaged, however, the power supply is automatically cut when overcurrrent is detected, protecting the inverter from damage.)
-  Replace the defective components if the inverter is found to be defective.
-  If both the compressor and the inverter are found to be defective, replace the defective component(s) of both devices.

## (1) Inverter-related problems: Troubleshooting and remedies

- 1) The INV board has a large-capacity electrolytic capacitor, in which residual voltage remains even after the main power is turned off, posing a risk of electric shock. Turn off the unit, leave it turned off for at least 10 minutes, and check that the voltage across FT-P and FT-N terminals on the INV board or the terminals at both ends of the electrolytic capacitor is 20V or below before checking inside the control box.
- (It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turn off.)
- 2) Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. (To plug or unplugconnectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.)
- 3) To connect wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.
- 4) Reconnect the connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.
- 5) The IPM on the inverter becomes damaged if there are loose screws are connectors. If a problem occurs after replacing some of the parts, mixed up wiring is often the cause of the problem. Check for proper connection of the wiring, screws, connectors, and Faston terminals.
- 6) To avoid damage to the circuit board, do not connect or disconnect the inverter-related connectors with the main power turned on.
- 7) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the terminals are securely locked in place after insertion.

Press the tab on the terminals to remove them.

- 8) When the IPM or IGBT is replaced, apply a thin layer of heat radiation grease that is supplied evenly to these parts. Wipe off any grease that may get on the wiring terminal to avoid terminal contact failure.
- 9) Faulty wiring to the compressor damages the compressor. Connect the wiring in the correct phase sequence.
- 10) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. (The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.)

The insulation resistance could go down to close to 1 M Ω after installation or when the power is kept off for an extended period of time because of the accumulation of refrigerant in the compressor. If the earth leakage breaker is triggered, please use the following procedure to take care of this.

-  Disconnect the wires from the compressor's terminal block.
-  If the resistance is less than 1 M Ω , switch on the power for the outdoor unit with the wires still disconnected.
-  Leave the power on for at least 12 hours.
-  Check that the resistance has recovered to 1 M Ω or greater.

## Earth leakage current measurement method

-  For easy on-site measurement of the earth leakage current, enable the filter with a measurement instrument that has filter functions as below, clamp all the power supply wires, and measure.

Recommended measurement instrument: CLAMP ON LEAK HiTESTER 3283 made by HIOKI E.E. CORPORATION  When measuring one device alone, measure near the device's power supply terminal block.

## 8-11-13 Simple Check on Inverter Circuit Components

## 8-11-14 Troubleshooting Problems with IGBT Module

Measure the resistances between each pair of terminals on the IGBT with a tester, and use the results for troubleshooting. The terminals on the INV board are used for the measurement.

## 1) Notes on measurement

-  Check the polarity before measuring. (On the tester, black normally indicates plus.)
-  Check that the resistance is not open ( ∞ Ω ) or not shorted (to 0 Ω ).
-  The values are for reference, and the margin of errors is allowed.
-  The result that is more than double or half of the result that is measured at the same measurement point is not allowed.  Disconnect all the wiring connected the INV board, and make the measurement.
- 2) Tester restriction
-  Use the tester whose internal electrical power source is 1.5V or greater
-  Use the dry-battery-powered tester.

(The accurate diode-specific resistance cannot be measured with the button-battery-powered card tester, as the applied voltage is low.)

-  Use a low-range tester if possible. A more accurate resistance can be measured.

## 9-1-1 How to Read the LED

By setting the DIP SW 4-1 through 4-10 (Set SW6-10 to OFF.)(Switch number 10 is represented by 0), the operating condition of the unit can be monitored on the service monitor. (Refer to the table on the following pages for DIP SW settings.) The service monitor uses 4-digit 7-segment LED to display numerical values and other types of information.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

 SW4-10 is set to "0" on the LED Status Indicators Table.

 In the example above, 1 through 9 are set to OFF, and 10 is set to ON.

Pressure and temperature are examples of numerical values, and operating conditions and the on-off status of solenoid valve are examples of flag display.

- 1) Display of numerical values

Example: When the pressure data sensor reads 18.8kg/cm$^{2}$ (Item No. 58)

-  The unit of pressure is in kg/cm 2
-  Use the following conversion formula to convert the displayed value into a value in SI unit.

Value in SI unit (MPa) = Displayed value (kg/cm$^{2}$) x 0.098

- 2) Flag display

Example: When 21S4a and SV1a are ON. (Item No. 3)

Example: 3-minutes restart mode (Item No. 14)

## 9-1-2 Initial LED Display

From power on until the completion of initial settings, the following information will be displayed on the monitor screen. (Displays No. 1 through No. 4 in order repeatedly.)

| No Item               | Display                                                                                                                                                                     |   Remarks |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Software version      | [0103] : Version 1.03                                                                                                                                                       |         1 |

| Model and capacity    | [H-20] : Cooling/Heating 20 HP For the first few minutes after power on, the capacity of  each outdoor unit is displayed. Thereafter, the com- bined capacity is displayed. |         3 |
| Communication address | [ 51] : Address 51                                                                                                                                                          |         4 |

After the initial settings have been completed, the information on these items can be checked by making the switch setting that corresponds to No. 517 in the LED display table.

Only item No. 1 "Software Version" appears on the display if there is a wiring failure between the control board and the transmission line power supply board or if the circuit board has failed.

## 9-1-3 Clock Memory Function

The outdoor unit has a simple clock function that enables the unit to calculate the current time with an internal timer by receiving the time set by the system controller, such as AG-150A.

If an error (including a preliminary error) occurs, the error history data and the error detection time are stored into the service memory.

The error detection time stored in the service memory and the current time can be seen on the service LED.

- 1) Use the time displayed on the service LED as a reference.
- 2) The date and the time are set to "00" by default. If a system controller that sets the time, such as AG-150A is not connected, the elapsed time and days since the first power on will be displayed.
- If the time set on a system controller is received, the count will start from the set date and the time.
- 3) The time is not updated while the power of the indoor unit is turned off. When the power is turned off and then on again, the count will resume from the time before the power was turned off. Thus, the time that differs the actual time will be displayed. (This also applies when a power failure occurs.)
- The system controller, such as AG-150A, adjusts the time once a day. When the system controller is connected, the time will be automatically updated to the correct current time after the time set by the system controller is received. (The data stored into the memory before the set time is received will not be updated.)
- (1) Reading the time data:
- 1) Time display

Example: 12 past 9

<!-- image -->

- * Disappears if the time data is deviated due to a power failure, or if a system controller that sets the time is not connected.
- 2) Date display

 When the main controller that can set the time is connected Example: May 10, 2003

<!-- image -->

- * Appears between the year and the month, and nothing appears when the date is displayed.

 When the main controller that can set the time is not connected Example: 52 days after power was turned on
