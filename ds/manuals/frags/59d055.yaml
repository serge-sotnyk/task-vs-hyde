    Your wireless camera is now ready to use. You can now utilize the mobile application or management website to review images, change camera settings, monitor battery life and other functions of the camera.

    ## SETTINGS MENU

    IMG. TYPE - Selects type of image files that are stored/ transmitted (note: see "Hybrid" under Video submenu).

    PHOTO - Still images will be captured by the camera at settings made in the PHOTO menu.

    VIDEO - Video clips will be captured at settings made in the VIDEO menu. NOTE: your full HD video files will be stored on the SD card, but they cannot be transmitted wirelessly due to the file size/cell carrier bandwidth.

    HYBRID - Captures a single image followed by a video clip.

    IMAGE SIZE - Selects resolution (in megapixels) for still photos. Higher resolution provides more pixels for increased detail, but creates larger files that take up more of the SD card capacity (fills up faster). Available settings are: 2, 8 and 20 (megapixels). 2 is the default setting, which will deliver excellent detail while still keeping the file size per image reasonable for most users.

    CAPTURE NUMBER - Selects the number of photos captured per trigger event, with settings from 1 to 5 (default is 1 photo per trigger).

      triggers after an initial detection, preventing redundant images.
    question: How does the PIR delay setting affect image capture?
  - answer: The PIR sensor can be set to activate during the day, night, or 24 hours
      a day.
    question: What are the different work modes for the camera's PIR sensor?
  - answer: Avoid aiming the camera at heat sources, tree branches, or brush to prevent
      false triggers from temperature and motion disturbances.
    question: What considerations should be made when mounting the camera to avoid
      false triggers?
  text: |+
    VIDEO SIZE - Selects resolution for video clips. Choice of 1280x720 (720p), or 960x544 (544p).

    VIDEO LENGTH - Selects duration of each video clip captured per trigger. The default setting is 5S (five seconds per video). From the 10 SEC setting up, length settings are in 5 second increments. Maximum video length is 20 Seconds.

    CAMERA NAME - Allows you to enter up to 12 characters of your choice to identify this camera. Especially useful for multi-camera setups. This will be imprinted on each photo. Default name is "CORE CAM".

    PIR DELAY - Selects the length of time that the camera will ignore additional triggers from the PIR after an animal is first detected and remains within the sensor's range. During this user set interval, the camera will not capture photos or videos. For example, if a second trigger event occurs 7 seconds after the first, but the delay time is set to 10 seconds, the second trigger will be ignored and a new image will not be captured until the 10 seconds has elapsed. Only the next trigger that occurs after 10 seconds will take a new photo/video, and so on. This prevents the card from filling up with too many redundant images. The default setting is 10 SEC (a ten second delay). From the 10 SEC setting up, delay settings are in 5 second increments. After scrolling past "59 SEC", settings go from "1 MIN" to "10 MIN" and then progress to 60 MIN at five-minute increments (15 MIN, 20MIN, etc.).

    WORK MODE - Determines when the PIR (passive infrared) sensor will activate the

    camera and capture images.

    DAY - 6:00 A.M. - 6:00 P.M.

    NIGHT - 6:00 P.M. - 6:00 A.M.

    24HRS - PIR Sensor triggers 24 hours a day.

    ## Flash Mode:

    SHORT RANGE - This is Medium LED output and fast shutter speed that is designed to capture good images of animals up close. This setting will provide the longest battery life but the shortest flash range.

    FAST MOTION - This setting has maximum flash output and fast shutter speed. It will provide the sharpest images and medium flash range and battery life.

    LONG RANGE - This setting has High LED output and Slow shutter speed and provides maximum flash range but the least battery life. You will also see more "motion blur" if the objects are moving quickly at night.

    TIMESTAMP - The date and time will be set once the camera has connected to the server and will be imprinted on all images.

    WIRELESS - Sets cellular signal transmission to ON (default) or OFF.

    ## Transmit Frequency:

    IMMEDIATELY - Images will be transmitted immediately after they are captured and saved to the SD card.

    DAILY - All new images will be transmitted only once daily.

    WEEKLY - All new images will be transmitted once per week.

    (This setting will give you the best battery life).

    ## MOUNTING & POSITIONING

    After you've set up the camera's settings to your preferences, you're ready start capturing images.

    We recommend mounting the camera on a sturdy tree or post with a diameter of about 6 in. To get the optimal picture quality, the camera should be about 16-17 ft. away from the place to be monitored, with the camera placed at a height of 3.5-5 ft. Also, keep in mind that you will get the best results at night when the subject is within the ideal flash range, no farther than 60' and no closer than 10' from the camera.

    The height away from the ground for placing the device should vary with the animal size appropriately. In general, 3 to 6 feet is preferred. You can avoid potential false triggers due to temperature and motion disturbances in front of the camera by not aiming it at a heat source or nearby tree branches or brush (especially on windy days).

    ## There are two ways to mount the camera:

    - Using the provided adjustable belt : Push one end of the belt through the two slots

    on the back of the trail camera. Thread the end of the strap through the buckle. Fasten the belt securely around the tree trunk by pulling the end of the strap firmly so there is no slack left.

    ## USING AN EXTERNAL POWER SOURCE

    ## (Power accessory not included)

    Connect the optional (119986C) Accessory Solar Panel (please visit www.bushnell.com for more information) to the "DC In" jack at the bottom of the camera (other external power supplies should not be used, as the camera and/ or display may not function correctly). If the solar panel is connected and AA batteries are installed, the camera will be powered by the solar panel's rechargeable lith-ion battery, as long as it provides adequate voltage (if not, the camera will switch to battery power). The solar panel's battery will power the camera at night.
