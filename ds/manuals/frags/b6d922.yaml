    ## Surface Temperature Measurement

    NOTE: The Lasergrip cannot measure the temperature of objects behind glass. Inaccuracy may also occur when exposed to steam, dust or any other contaminants in the air.

    HOLD for continuous temperature reading

    <!-- image -->

    RELEASE to lock the temperature result

    - 1. Once the battery is properly installed, press the measurement trigger to activate the device.
    - 2. Point the Lasergrip towards the surface of measurement.
    - 3. Press and hold the measurement trigger and the lasers will activate for aiming guidance.
    - 4. Keep holding the trigger as you move the Lasergrip if you wish to live scan the surface area for temperature measurement.
    - 5. The area between each laser point is the area of measurement. Once the lasers are pointed to the desired area of measurement, release the trigger and the LCD display will lock the calculated temperature.
    - 6. Press the measurement trigger once again to make another measurement.

    NOTE : The Lasergrip LCD will display 'HI' when the measured temperature is above the measurable range, and will display '1.0' when the measured temperature is below the measurable range.

    ## Unit Conversion

    To switch the unit of measurement between ºF and ºc, press and hold the display backlight button for 3 seconds.

    ## Measurement Modes

    Press the mode button repeatedly to cycle through and select from the following measurement modes:

    | Mode   | Function                                                                                                                 |
    |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | MAX    | Displays the maximum recorded temperature for the last measurement.                                                      |
    | MIN    | Displays the minimum recorded temperature for the last measurement.                                                      |
    | AVG    | Displays the average temperature for the last measurement.                                                               |
    | DIF    | Displays the difference between the highest and lowest recorded temperatures for the last measurement taken.             |
    | EMS    | Allows you to adjust the value of emissivity for different surface materials.                                            |
    | HAL    | High Temperature Alarm:  The thermometer will beep continuously if a temperature greater than the set value is recorded. |
    | LAL    | Low Temperature Alarm:  The thermometer will beep continuously if a temperature lower than the set value is recorded.    |

    NOTE: To adjust the value in EMS, HAL, and LAL mode, use the UP and DOWN buttons on the thermometer.

    ## Battery Replacement

    A low battery icon will appear on the LCD display when the Lasergrip's battery power is running low. Immediately replace the battery when the icon appears.

    9V Battery

    <!-- image -->

    - 1. Open the battery compartment and remove the used battery. Dispose the used battery properly.
    - 2. Connect a new DC 9V battery, making sure it's under the correct polarity.
    - 3. Insert the battery into the compartment and close the compartment lid, making sure the wiring is not being pinched by the compartment lid.

    ## Distance-Spot Ratio

    The Lasergrip 630 measures surface temperature on the basis of distance to spot diameter ratio (D:S). As the distance between the thermometer and the surface increases, the total surface area measured will also increase. With a distance to spot ratio of 16:1 the surface area measured has a diameter of roughly 1/16 the distance. For the most accurate results, stand at a distance where the two laser points overlap (approximately 14 inches away from the spot of measurement). Otherwise, the space between each laser point marks the diameter for the area of measurement.

    DISTANCE (D) TO SPOT SIZE (S) DS = 16.1

    ## Emissivity

    The emissivity of a material is its efficiency in emitting thermal energy. Non-reflective surfaces have a higher emissivity (closer to 1) than reflective surfaces (closer to 0). Inaccurate results may occur when measuring reflective surfaces such as glass, polished wood, and garnite. To take accurate temperature measurement of reflective

    surfaces with low emissivity, adjust the emissivity value before measurement using the reference chart. Or, place a strip of masking tape over the surface and allow for it to adjust to the temperature of the surface for approximately 30 minutes. Measure the surface, scanning the taped section, eliminating the issue of inaccuracy.
