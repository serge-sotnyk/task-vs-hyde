    \ during and immediately after operation.\n\nTo reduce the risk of burns, do not\
    \ touch any electrical parts with bare hands during or immediately after stopping\
    \ operation.\n\nTo reduce the risk of injury from falling tools, keep children\
    \ away while installing, inspecting, or repairing the unit.\n\nKeep the space\
    \ well ventilated. Refrigerant can displace air and cause oxygen starvation. If\
    \ leaked refrigerant comes in contact with a heat source, toxic gas may be generated.\n\
    \nAlways replace a fuse with one with the correct current rating. The use of improperly\
    \ rated fuses or a substitution of fuses with steel or copper wire may result\
    \ in bursting, fire or explosion.\n\nTo reduce the risk of electric shock, smoke,\
    \ and fire due to infiltration of dust and water, properly install all required\
    \ covers.\n\nTo reduce the risk of electric shock, smoke, and fire due to infiltration\
    \ of dust and water, properly install all required terminal block covers and insulation\
    \ sheets.\n\nTo reduce the risk of fire or explosion, do not place flammable materials\
    \ or use flammable sprays around the unit.\n\nTo reduce the risk of being caught\
    \ in rotating parts, electric shock, and burns, do not operate the unit without\
    \ all required panels and guards being installed.\n\nTo reduce the risk of injury,\
    \ do not sit, stand, or place objects on the unit.\n\nThe unit described in this\
    \ manual is not intended for use with food, animals, plants, precision instruments,\

    To reduce the risk of wire shorting, electric shock, malfunctions, or fire, keep circuit boards dust free, and do not touch them with your hands or tools.

    [7] AdditionalPrecautions

    ## Additional Precautions

    To avoid damage to the unit, use appropriate tools to install, inspect, or repair the unit.

    Use properly rated breakers and fuses (inverter circuit breaker, local switch <switch + fuse>, no-fuse breaker). The use of a breaker with a breaking capacity greater than the specified capacity may cause electric shock, malfunctions, smoke, or fire. (Applicable to inverter units only)

    To reduce the risk of current leakage, overheating, smoke, or fire, use properly rated cables with adequate current carrying capacity.

    Proper grounding must be provided by a licensed electrician.

    Do not connect the grounding wire to a gas pipe, water pipe, lightning rod, or telephone wire. Improper grounding may result in electric shock, smoke, fire, or malfunction due to electrical noise interference.

    To reduce the risk of wire shorting, electric leak, electric shock, smoke, or fire, do not perform maintenance work in the rain.

    To reduce the risk of injury, electric shock, and fire, properly reinstall all removed components after completing repair work.

    To reduce the risk of refrigerant and water leakage, check the pipe supports and insulation for damage during inspection or repair, and replace or repair the ones that are found to be deteriorated.

    To reduce the risk or malfunction, turn on the power at least 12 hours before starting operation, and leave the power turned on throughout the operating season.

    Recover all refrigerant in the units, and dispose of it properly according to any applicable laws and regulations.

    To reduce the risk of deterioration of refrigerant oil and compressor malfunctions caused by a refrigerant that contains chloride, such as R22, only use R410A.

    Provide a maintenance access to allow for the inspection of pipes above the ceiling or the buried pipes.

    Take appropriate measures against electrical noise interference when installing the air conditioners in hospitals or facilities with radio communication capabilities. Inverter, high-frequency medical, or wireless communication equipment as well as power generators may cause the air conditioning system to malfunction. Air conditioning system may also adversely affect the operation of these types of equipment by creating electrical noise.

    To reduce the risk of damage to the unit, leave the valves on the unit closed until refrigerant charging is completed.

    Place a wet towel on the refrigerant service valve before brazing the pipes to keep its temperature from rising above 120ºC and damaging the surrounding equipment.

    Direct the blazing torch flame away from the adjacent cables and sheet metal to keep them from being overheated and damaged.

    Prepare tools for exclusive use with R410A. Do not use the following tools if they have been used with the conventional refrigerant (R22): gauge manifold, charging hose, refrigerant leak detector, check valve, refrigerant charge spout, vacuum gauge, and refrigerant recovery equipment. R410A does not contain chloride, so leak detectors for use with older types of refrigerants will not detect an R410A leak. Infiltration of the residual refrigerant, refrigerant oil, or water on these tools may cause the refrigerant oil in the new system to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    To reduce the risk of the vacuum pump oil backflowing into the refrigerant cycle and causing the refrigerant oil to deteriorate, use a vacuum pump with a check valve.

    Have a set of tools for exclusive use with R410A. Consult your nearest Mitsubishi Electric Dealer.

    Keep dust, dirt, and water off charging hose and flare tool. Infiltration of dust, dirt, or water into the refrigerant circuit may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    Use refrigerant piping and couplings that meet the applicable standards. For refrigerant pipes, use pipes made of phosphorus deoxidized copper. Keep the inner and outer surfaces of pipes and couplings clean and free of such contaminants as sulfur, oxides, dust, dirt, shaving particles, oil, and moisture. Failure to follow these directions may result in the deterioration of refrigerant oil or compressor damage.

    Store the piping materials indoors, and keep both ends of the pipes sealed until immediately before brazing. Keep elbows and other joints in plastic bags. Infiltration of dust, dirt, or water into the refrigerant circuit may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    Apply ester oil, ether oil, or a small amount of alkyl benzene to flares and flanges. The use and accidental infiltration of mineral oil into the system may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    To reduce the risk of oxidized film from entering the refrigerant pipe and causing the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damaging the compressor, braze pipes under nitrogen purge.

    Do not use the existing refrigerant piping. A large amount of chloride that is contained in the residual refrigerant and refrigerant oil in the existing piping may cause the refrigerant oil in the new unit to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    Charge refrigerant in the liquid state. If refrigerant is charged in the gas phase, the composition of the refrigerant in the cylinder will change, compromising the unit's performance.

    Do not use a charging cylinder. The use of a charging cylinder will change the composition of the refrigerant, compromising the unit's performance.

    Charge the system with an appropriate amount of refrigerant in the liquid phase. Refer to the relevant sections in the manuals to calculate the appropriate amount of refrigerant to be charged. Refrigerant overcharge or undercharge may result in performance drop or abnormal stop of operation.

    To reduce the risk of power capacity shortage, always use a dedicated power supply circuit.

    To reduce the risk of both the breaker on the product side and the upstream breaker from tripping and causing problems, split the power supply system or provide protection coordination between the earth leakage breaker and no-fuse breaker.

    Have a backup system, if failure of the unit has a potential for causing significant problems or damages.

  text: |+
    As with R22, the new refrigerant (R410A) is low in toxicity and chemically stable nonflammable refrigerant. However, because the specific gravity of vapor refrigerant is greater than that of air, leaked refrigerant in a closed room will accumulate at the bottom of the room and may cause hypoxia. If exposed to an open flame, refrigerant will generate poisonous gases. Do not perform installation or service work in a confined area.

    ## 2. Refrigerant composition

    R410A is a pseudo-azeotropic HFC blend and can almost be handled the same way as a single refrigerant, such as R22. To be safe, however, draw out the refrigerant from the cylinder in the liquid phase. If the refrigerant in the gaseous phase is drawn out, the composition of the remaining refrigerant will change and become unsuitable for use. If the refrigerant leaks out, it may be replenished. The entire refrigerant does not need to be replaced.

    ## 1-2-5 Refrigerant Oil

    ## 1. Refrigerating machine oil in the HFC refrigerant system

    HFC type refrigerants use a refrigerating machine oil different from that used in the R22 system. Note that the ester oil used in the system has properties that are different from commercially available ester oil.

    | Refrigerant   | Refrigerating machine oil   |
    |---------------|-----------------------------|
    | R22           | Mineral oil                 |

    ## 2. Effects of contaminants *1

    Refrigerating machine oil used in the HFC system must be handled with special care to keep contaminants out. The table below shows the effect of contaminants in the refrigerating machine oil on the refrigeration cycle.

    \ with Refrigerant Piping\n\n## 1-3-1 Pipe Brazing\n\nNo changes have been made\
    \ in the brazing procedures. Perform brazing with special care to keep foreign\
    \ objects (such as oxide scale, water, and dust) out of the refrigerant system.\n\
    \nExample: Inside the brazed connection\n\nUse of no inert gas during brazing\n\
    \nUse of inert gas during brazing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Items to be strictly\
    \ observed\n\n- \x8C Do not conduct refrigerant piping work outdoors if raining.\n\
    - \x8C Use inert gas during brazing.\n- \x8C Use a brazing material (BCuP-3) that\
    \ requires no flux when brazing between copper pipes or between a copper pipe\
    \ and copper coupling.\n- \x8C If installed refrigerant pipes are not immediately\
    \ connected to the equipment, then braze and seal both ends.\n\n## 2. Reasons\n\
    \n- \x8C The new refrigerating machine oil is 10 times as hygroscopic as the conventional\
    \ oil and is more likely to cause unit failure if water infiltrates into the system.\n\
    - \x8C Flux generally contains chloride. Residual flux in the refrigerant circuit\
    \ will cause sludge to form.\n\n## 3. Notes\n\nDo not use commercially available\
    \ antioxidants because they may cause the pipes to corrode or refrigerating machine\
    \ oil to deteriorate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1-3-2 Air Tightness Test\n\nNo changes\
    \ have been made in the detection method. Note that a refrigerant leak detector\
    \ for R22 will not detect an R410A leak.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\
    \n## 1. Items to be strictly observed\n\n\x8C Pressurize the equipment with nitrogen\
    \ up to the design pressure (4.15MPa[601psi]), and then judge the equipment's\
    \ air tightness, taking temperature variations into account.\n\n- \x8C Refrigerant\
    \ R410A must be charged in its liquid state (vs. gaseous state).\n\n## 2. Reasons\n\
    \n\x8C Oxygen, if used for an air tightness test, poses a risk of explosion. (Only\
    \ use nitrogen to check air tightness.) \x8C Refrigerant R410A must be charged\
    \ in its liquid state. If gaseous refrigerant in the cylinder is drawn out first,\
    \ the composition of the remaining refrigerant in the cylinder will change and\
    \ become unsuitable for use.\n\n## 3. Notes\n\nProcure a leak detector that is\
    \ specifically designed to detect an HFC leak. A leak detector for R22 will not\
    \ detect an HFC(R410A) leak.\n\n## 1-3-3 Vacuum Drying\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Photo1)\

    \ Vacuum Gauge\n\n## 1. Vacuum pump with a reverse-flow check valve (Photo1)\n\
    \nTo prevent the vacuum pump oil from flowing into the refrigerant circuit during\
    \ power OFF or power failure, use a vacuum pump with a reverse-flow check valve.\n\
    \n## 2. Standard of vacuum degree (Photo 2)\n\nUse a vacuum pump that attains\
    \ 0.5Torr(65Pa) or lower degree of vacuum after 5 minutes of operation, and connect\
    \ it directly to the vacuum gauge. Use a pump well-maintained with an appropriate\
    \ lubricant. A poorly maintained vacuum pump may not be able to attain the desired\
    \ degree of vacuum.\n\n## 3. Required precision of vacuum gauge\n\nUse a vacuum\
    \ gauge that registers a vacuum degree of 5Torr(650Pa) and measures at intervals\
    \ of 1Torr(130Pa). (A recommended vacuum gauge is shown in Photo2.)\n\nDo not\
    \ use a commonly used gauge manifold because it cannot register a vacuum degree\
    \ of 5Torr(650Pa).\n\n## 4. Evacuation time\n\n\x8C After the degree of vacuum\
    \ has reached 5Torr(650Pa), evacuate for an additional 1 hour. (A thorough vacuum\
    \ drying removes moisture in the pipes.)\n\n- \x8C Verify that the vacuum degree\
    \ has not risen by more than 1Torr(130Pa) 1hour after evacuation. A rise by less\
    \ than 1Torr(130Pa) is acceptable.\n- \x8C If the vacuum is lost by more than\
    \ 1Torr(130Pa), conduct evacuation, following the instructions in section 6. Special\
    \ vacuum drying.\n\n## 5. Procedures for stopping vacuum pump\n\n"

      the charge hose before stopping.
    question: What should be done to prevent vacuum pump oil from flowing backward
      when stopping the pump?
  - answer: It is likely that water has entered the system or there is a leak.
    question: If a vacuum of 5 Torr cannot be reached after 3 hours of evacuation,
      what are the likely causes?
  - answer: Only nitrogen gas should be used.
    question: When breaking a vacuum during special vacuum drying, what gas should
      be used?
  - answer: A micron gauge should be used, not system manifold gauges.
    question: During triple evacuation, what type of gauge should be used to measure
      vacuum?
  - answer: It should be drawn in the liquid phase.
    question: When charging R410A refrigerant, in what state should it be drawn from
      the cylinder?

    \n- \x8C When 5Torr(650Pa) or lower degree of vacuum cannot be attained after\
    \ 3 hours of evacuation, it is likely that water has penetrated the system or\
    \ that there is a leak.\n- \x8C If water infiltrates the system, break the vacuum\
    \ with nitrogen. Pressurize the system with nitrogen gas to\n- 0.5kgf/cm$^{2}$G(0.05MPa)\
    \ and evacuate again. Repeat this cycle of pressurizing and evacuation either\
    \ until the degree of vacuum below 5Torr(650Pa) is attained or until the pressure\
    \ stops rising.\n- \x8C Only use nitrogen gas for vacuum breaking. (The use of\
    \ oxygen may result in an explosion.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 7. Triple Evacuation\n\
    \n- The method below can also be used to evacuate the system.\n- \x8C Evacuate\
    \ the system to 4,000 microns from both service valves. System manifold gauges\
    \ must not be used to measure vacuum. A micron gauge must be used at all times.\
    \ Break the vacuum with Nitrogen (N2) into the discharge service valve to 0 PSIG.\n\
    - \x8C Evacuate the system to 1,500 microns from the suction service valve. Break\
    \ the vacuum with Nitrogen (N2) into the discharge service valve to 0 PSIG.\n\
    - \x8C Evacuate the system to 500 microns. System must hold the vacuum at 500\
    \ microns for a minimum of 1 hour.\n- \x8C Conduct a rise test for a minimum of\
    \ 30 minutes\n\n## 8. Notes\n\n- \x8C To evacuate air from the entire system\n\
    - Applying a vacuum through the check joints at the refrigerant service valve\
    \ on the high and low pressure sides (BV1 and 2) is not enough to attain the desired\
    \ vacuum pressure.\n- Be sure to apply a vacuum through the check joints at the\
    \ refrigerant service valve on the high and low pressure sides (BV1 and 2) and\
    \ also through the check joints on the high and low pressure sides (CJ1 and 2).\

    \ point R32=-52°C[-62°F], R125=-49°C[-52°F]) and can almost be handled the same\
    \ way as a single refrigerant, such as R22. To be safe, however, draw out the\
    \ refrigerant from the cylinder in the liquid phase. If the refrigerant in the\
    \ gaseous phase is drawn out, the composition of the remaining refrigerant will\
    \ change and become unsuitable for use.\n\n## 2. Notes\n\nWhen using a cylinder\
    \ with a siphon, refrigerant is charged in the liquid state without the need for\
    \ turning it upside down. Check the type of the cylinder on the label before use.\n\

    \n- \x8C Control boxes house high-voltage and high-temperature electrical parts.\n\
    - \x8C They may still remain energized or hot after the power is turned off.\n\
    - \x8C When opening or closing the front cover of the control box, keep out of\

    - 1) "Maximum total capacity of connectable indoor units" refers to the sum of the numeric values in the indoor unit model names.
    - 2) If the total capacity of the indoor units that are connected to a given outdoor unit exceeds the capacity of the outdoor unit, the indoor units will not be able to perform at the rated capacity when they are operated simultaneously. Select a combination of units so that the total capacity of the connected indoor units is at or below the capacity of the outdoor unit whenever possible.

    ## 2-2 Types and Maximum Allowable Length of Cables

    ## 1. Wiring work

    ## (1) Notes

    - 1) Have all electrical work performed by an authorized electrician according to the local regulations and instructions in this manual.
    - 2) Install external transmission cables at least 5cm [1-31/32"] away from the power supply cable to avoid noise interference. (Do not put the control cable and power supply cable in the same conduit tube.)
    - 3) Provide grounding for the outdoor unit as required.
    - 4) Run the cable from the electric box of the indoor or outdoor unit in such way that the box is accessible for servicing.
    - 5) Do not connect power supply wiring to the terminal block for transmission line. Doing so will damage the electronic components on the terminal block.
    - 6) Use 2-core shielded cables as transmission cables.

    Use a separate 2-core control cable for each refrigerant system. Do not use a single multiple-core cable to connect indoor units that belong to different refrigerant systems. The use of a multiple-core cable may result in signal transmission errors and malfunctions.

    The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS.

    They are designated as OC and OS in the descending order of capacity (ascending order of address if the capacities are the same).

    ## 2-7-2 Single Refrigerant System with Two or More LOSSNAY Units

    ## (1) Sample control wiring

    <!-- image -->

    * If the BC address overlaps any of the addresses that are assigned to either the OC, OS, or BS, use a different, unused address. OC, OS, and BS addresses (lowest indoor unit address in the group plus +50) have higher priority than the BS address.

    ## (2) Cautions

    - 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
    - 2) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR30MAAU.

  qa_pairs:
  - answer: The main unit in a group should be assigned the smallest address.
    question: When setting addresses for indoor units, what is the primary rule for
      assigning addresses to the main unit within a group?
  - answer: 'The order should be: main BC controller, then sub BC controller 1, and
      then sub BC controller 2.'
    question: In a system with a sub BC controller, what is the correct order for
      setting indoor unit addresses?
  - answer: Sub units should be assigned sequential addresses, starting with the main
      unit's address plus one.
    question: How should addresses be assigned to sub units within an indoor unit
      group?
  - answer: Assign arbitrary but unique addresses to each LOSSNAY unit, ensuring they
      do not overlap with any indoor unit addresses.
    question: After setting addresses for all indoor units, how should addresses be
      assigned to LOSSNAY units?
  - answer: The indoor unit with the greatest number of functions should be designated
      as the main unit.
    question: When performing group operations with indoor units that have different
      functions, how should the main unit be designated?

  - answer: They are automatically designated as OC and OS, based on descending capacity,
      or ascending address if capacities are the same.
    question: How are outdoor units labeled within the same refrigerant circuit?
  - answer: No more than two MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of
      indoor units, and a pair of PAR-30MAAU cannot be connected.
    question: If connecting multiple remote controllers, what is the limitation for
      MA remote controllers?
  - answer: A transmission booster is required when the number of connected indoor
      units exceeds a certain threshold, which varies depending on whether P72 and
      P96 models are included.
    question: When should a transmission booster be used?
  - answer: The maximum combined length is 200 meters.
    question: What is the maximum combined length of the indoor/outdoor transmission
      lines (L11+L12 and L21+L22)?

  - answer: First, configure the indoor units connected to the main BC controller,
      then those connected to sub BC controller 1, and so on.
    question: When setting up a system with a sub BC controller, what is the order
      for configuring indoor units?
  - answer: Assign unique addresses to each LOSSNAY unit, ensuring they do not overlap
      with any indoor unit addresses.
    question: How should addresses be assigned to LOSSNAY units?
  - answer: Outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit should be assigned sequential
      addresses.
    question: What is the relationship between the addresses of outdoor units in the
      same refrigerant circuit?
  - answer: Its address should equal the sum of the smallest address of indoor units
      connected to it plus 50.
    question: How is the address for a sub BC controller determined?
  - answer: Use a different, unused address within the setting range.
    question: What should be done if the main BC controller address overlaps with
      outdoor or sub BC controller addresses?

    \ for centralized control, replace the power jumper connector on the control board\
    \ from CN41 to CN40 on only one of the outdoor units.\n\nWhen connecting a system\
    \ controller, set the centralized control switch (SW5-1) on the control board\
    \ of all indoor units to \"ON.\"\n\nb) If TB7's on the outdoor units in the same\
    \ refrigerant cir-\n\ncuit are not daisy-chained, connect the transmission line\
    \ for the central control system to TB7 of the OC. (Note a).To maintain the central\
    \ control even during an OC failure or a power failure, connect TB7 on OC and\
    \ OS together. (If there is a problem with the outdoor unit whose power jumper\
    \ was moved from CN41 to CN40, central control is not possible, even if TB7's\
    \ are daisy-chained.)\n\n- c) When connecting TB7, only commence after checking\
    \ that the voltage is below 20 VDC.\n\n\x8C Only use shielded cables.\n\n## Shielded\
    \ cable connection\n\nDaisy-chain the S terminal of the terminal block (TB7) on\
    \ the system controller, OC, and OS with the shield of the shielded cable. Short-circuit\
    \ the earth terminal ( ) and the S terminal on the terminal block (TB7) on the\
    \ outdoor unit whose power jumper connector is mated with CN40.\n\n## 3) MA remote\

    \ (LC). (Non-polarized two-wire)\n\n- \x8C Indoor units must be interlocked with\
    \ the LOSSNAY unit using the system controller. (Refer to the operation manual\

  - answer: When P72 and P96 models are included, fewer indoor units can be connected
      compared to when they are not included.
    question: How does the inclusion of P72 and P96 models affect the number of indoor
      units that can be connected when using three BC controllers?
  - answer: For each BC controller removed, two additional indoor units can be connected.
    question: What happens to the number of connectable indoor units if you remove
      a BC controller from the system?
  - answer: The maximum total length for the ME remote controller wiring is 10m for
      m1 and 10m for m2+m3. Any extension beyond this must be included in the maximum
      indoor-outdoor transmission line distance.
    question: What is the maximum length allowed for the ME remote controller wiring
      if standard cable is extended?
  - answer: Use cables sized between 0.75 and 1.25 mm² (AWG18-16).
    question: What cable size should be used when connecting to the terminal block
      on the Simple remote controller?
  - answer: The ME remote controller can be connected anywhere on the indoor-outdoor
      transmission line.
    question: Where can the ME remote controller be connected on the system?

  - answer: The power jumper connector on CN41 should be left in its factory setting.
    question: When a power supply unit is connected for centralized control, what
      should be done with the power jumper connector on CN41?
  - answer: The number of connectable indoor units depends on the number of transmission
      boosters, with different ranges based on whether P72 and P96 models are included.
    question: What is the relationship between the number of transmission boosters
      and the number of connectable indoor units?
  - answer: Yes, address setting is required.
    question: Is address setting required, and if so, what does it depend on?

    - 1) Exercise caution not to damage the bottom and the front panel of the control box. Damage to these parts affect the waterproof and dust proof properties of the control box and may result in damage to its internal components.
    - 2) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the cable heads are securely locked in place. Press the tab on the terminals to remove them.
    - 3) Control box houses high temperature parts. Be well careful even after turning off the power source.
    - 4) Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. To plug or unplugconnectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.
    - 5) To connect wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.
    - 6) Reconnect the connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.
    - 7) When opening or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact with any of the internal components. Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes, and confirm that the capacitor voltage (inverter main circuit) has dropped to 20 VDC or less. It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turned off.
    - 8) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.

  - answer: The model setting for the outdoor unit's static pressure should be set
      before powering on the unit.
    question: When should I set the model setting for the outdoor unit's static pressure?
  - answer: Setting the system to performance-priority mode will terminate the low-noise
      mode.
    question: If I set the system to performance-priority mode, what happens to low-noise
      mode?
  - answer: The low-noise mode reduces operation noise by controlling compressor frequencies
      and the rotation speed of the outdoor unit fans.
    question: What does the low-noise mode do?
  - answer: The display setting for self-diagnosis/function can be changed anytime
      after the power is on.
    question: For the self-diagnosis/function setting, when can I change the display
      setting?
  - answer: It means that the switches on both the OC and OS need to be set to the
      same setting for the setting to be effective.
    question: If a switch setting requires both OC and OS to be set, what does this
      mean?

    - 1) To change the settings, set SW6-10 to ON, set SW4, and press and hold SWP01 for 2 seconds or longer (OFF ↔ ON). LED3 will light up when the switch setting is ON, and lights off when OFF.

    Use the LED3 display to confirm that the settings are properly made.

    - The settings will need to be set again when the control board is replaced. Write down the settings on the electrical wiring drawing label.
    - 2) A: OC: Only the switch on OC needs to be set for the setting to be effective.
    - B: OC: The switches on both the OC and OS need to be set to the same seeing for the setting to be effective.
    - C: OC: The switches on both the OC and OS need to be set.
    - D: OC: The switch on either the OC or OS needs to be set.
    - 3) For details, refer to the following page(s).[5-2-7 Defrost Operation Control](page 127)
    - 4) The table below shows how the target evaporation temperature is set with SW4 (982).

    <!-- image -->

    - 5) Unless otherwise specified, leave the switch to OFF where indicated by "-" or where the cells are blank, which may be set to OFF for a reason.
    - 6) The settings that are configured with SW4 (SW6-10: ON) will automatically be stored on the indoor units that support the new function*. The stored settings will automatically be restored when the outdoor unit control board is replaced.
    - If none of the connected indoor units supports the new function, no configuration information will be saved. If this is the case, manually record the settings configuration on the control box panel.
    - *The new function is supported on most units that are manufactured in December of 2012 and later. Depending on the model, this function may be added on later date. Ask your dealer for further details.
    - 7) The table below shows the combinations of the settings for items No.929 and No.935 and the Heating Capacity mode setting that corresponds to each combination.

    To prevent incorrect temperature detection due to a build-up of warm air around the indoor unit, use the built-in temperature sensor on the remote controller (SW1-1) instead of the one on the indoor unit inlet thermistor.

    Note 3. By setting SW3-1, SW1-7, and SW1-8 to a certain configuration, the fan can be set to remain stopped during cooling Thermo-OFF. See the table below for details.

    Note 4. The settings that are configured from the remote controller will automatically be stored on the outdoor unit. The stored settings will automatically be restored when the indoor unit control board is replaced.

    The switch setting may vary depending on the indoor unit's type. Refer to relevant Service Handbook for details.

    ## (2) Address switch

    Actual indoor unit address setting varies in different systems. Refer to the installation manual for the outdoor unit for details on how to make the address setting.

    Each address is set with a combination of the settings for the 10's digit and 1's digit. (Example)

    When setting the address to "3", set the 1's digit to 3, and the 10's digit to 0. When setting the address to "25", set the 1's digit to 5, and the 10's digit to 2.

    ## 5-1-3 Remote Controller Switch Functions and Factory Settings

    ## (1) MA remote controller (PAR-20MAU)

    The SW is located at the bottom of the remote controller under the cover. Operate the switches to perform the remote controller main/sub setting or other function settings. Normally, do not change the settings of switches other than the SW1 (main/ sub switching switch). (All the switches are set to "ON" at factory setting.)

  - answer: The defrost cycle will not start if other outdoor units are in a defrost
      cycle or if less than 10 minutes have passed since the last defrost cycle ended.
    question: Under what conditions will the defrost cycle not start?
  - answer: A forced defrost cycle can be started by setting DIP SW4 (913) to ON,
      provided at least 10 minutes have passed since compressor startup or the last
      defrost cycle.
    question: How can a forced defrost cycle be initiated?
  - answer: If the previous defrost cycle lasted 12 minutes, the next defrost cycle
      will be prohibited for only 50 minutes, even if the defrost-prohibit timer is
      set to 90 or 150 minutes.
    question: How does the duration of the previous defrost cycle affect the next
      one?
  - answer: All units operating in heating mode will simultaneously enter the defrost
      cycle.
    question: What happens to units in heating mode when a defrost cycle begins in
      a multi-unit system?
  - answer: Non-operating units may or may not enter the defrost cycle depending on
      their cumulative compressor operation time.
    question: How does the compressor operation time affect whether non-operating
      units enter the defrost cycle?

  - answer: The defrost cycle will end early if the pipe temperature reaches 25°C
      when SW4 is OFF, or 25°C plus TH7 when SW4 is ON.
    question: Under what conditions will a defrost cycle end before the two-minute
      minimum?
  - answer: In a multiple-outdoor-unit system, all units stop defrosting at the same
      time.
    question: How does a multiple-outdoor-unit system handle defrosting?
  - answer: If a problem is detected, the defrost operation will stop, and a 20-minute
      defrost prohibition will be set.
    question: What happens if a problem occurs during the defrost operation?
  - answer: On-defrost starts when the outside temperature, cumulative compressor
      time, and piping temperature meet specific conditions, and SW4 (848) is ON.
    question: What are the requirements for initiating an on-defrost operation?
  - answer: During defrost, SV5b is ON for single units but OFF for combination units,
      while SV10 and SV11 are ON for combination units but operate differently for
      single units.
    question: How do the valve operations differ between a single outdoor unit and
      a combination unit during a defrost cycle?

  - answer: The defrost cycle ends when a set time is reached or when specific piping
      temperatures remain above a threshold for three minutes.
    question: Under what conditions does the defrost cycle end?
  - answer: Refrigerant recovery during heating prevents refrigerant accumulation
      in units that are stopped or in certain modes.
    question: What is the purpose of refrigerant recovery during heating operation?
  - answer: The cycle starts after a specific time since the last cycle and when a
      certain temperature (TH4) is exceeded.
    question: What triggers the refrigerant recovery cycle in cooling or heating modes?
  - answer: Oil collection is performed by setting the compressor frequency to a specific
      value for a maximum of four minutes after a period of low frequency operation.
    question: How is oil collection performed during low compressor frequency?
  - answer: During cooling, the fan speed is adjusted to maintain a constant condensing
      temperature, and during heating, to maintain a constant evaporation temperature.

  - answer: LEV5 control starts when the unit is in Heating-Only or Heating-Main mode,
      TH7 is below 5°C, 63LS is below 0.69MPa, and TH15 is below 4°C.
    question: Under what conditions does the LEV5 valve begin to control?
  - answer: LEV5 control stops if the unit is not in Heating-Main or Heating-Only
      mode, TH7 rises above 10°C, 63LS exceeds 0.98MPa, or when SV4a, b, and d are
      turned off.
    question: What causes the LEV5 valve control to stop?
  - answer: The LEV4 valve adjusts every 30 seconds.
    question: How often does the LEV4 valve adjust to control compressor discharge
      superheat?
  - answer: The target compressor discharge superheat is 30°C.
    question: What is the target compressor discharge superheat when the compressor
      frequency is between 72 and 82 Hz?
  - answer: The initial startup mode completes after 35 minutes of integrated operation
      time if the frequency is 60Hz or more, or after 90 minutes if the frequency
      is less than 50Hz, unless the discharge superheat remains above 25 degrees for

    question: What happens if the total capacity of the indoor units exceeds the maximum
      allowable capacity?
  - answer: When communication is restored, the emergency mode is canceled, and the
      units return to normal operation.
    question: How does the system transition out of emergency mode?
  - answer: The indoor units can operate in cooling, heating, dry, automatic cooling/heating,
      fan, or stopping modes.
    question: What are the available operation modes for indoor units?
  - answer: The operation mode (cooling main or heating main) is determined based
      on the refrigerant pressure in the R2 refrigerant circuit and speed variation
      data.
    question: How is the outdoor unit's operation mode determined when both cooling
      and heating are active?
  - answer: It uses an autonomous distributed control system, consisting of three
      independent sub-control systems.

    ## 5-2-18 Operation Mode

    ## (1) Indoor unit operation mode

    The operation mode can be selected from the following 6 modes using the remote controller.

    |   1 | Cooling mode                    |
    |-----|---------------------------------|
    |   2 | Heating mode                    |
    |   3 | Dry mode                        |
    |   4 | Automatic cooling/heating  mode |
    |   5 | Fan mode                        |
    |   6 | Stopping mode                   |

    ## (2) Outdoor unit operation mode

    |   1 | Cooling only mode   | All indoor units in operation are in cooling mode.   |
    |-----|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
    |   2 | Heating only mode   | All indoor units in operation are in heating mode.   |
    |   3 | Cooling main mode   | Coexistence of units in cooling and heating modes.   |
    |   4 | Heating main mode   | Coexistence of units in cooling and heating modes.   |
    |   5 | Stopping mode       | All indoor units are in fan mode or stopping mode.   |

    When units in cooing and heating coexist, the operation mode (cooling main mode or heating main mode) will be determined, based on the refrigerant pressure in the R2 refrigerant circuit and speed variation data.

    ## (3) Operation pattern for automatic cooling/heating mode

    When the automatic cooling/heating mode is selected from remote controller functions, the indoor temperature will be detected in pattern as shown in the figure below, and the operation mode (cooling or heating) will automatically be selected.

    ## 5-2-19 Demand Control

    Cooling/heating operation can be prohibited (Thermo-OFF) by an external input to the indoor units.

    When DIP SW6-8 is set to ON, the 4-step DEMAND control is enabled. Eight-step demand control is possible in the system with two outdoor units.

    For details, refer to the following page(s). [2-4-7 Various Control Methods Using the Signal Input/Output Connector on Outdoor Unit](page 26)

    ## 5-3 BC Controller Control

    ## 1. Control of SV A, SV B, and SV C

    SV A, SV B, and SV C turn on or off depending on the operation mode of the branch.

    ## 5-4 Operation Flowcharts

    ## 5-4-1 Operation Sequence Flowchart

    - (1) Indoor unit (cooling, heating, dry, fan mode)

    <!-- image -->

    - *Note 1. Indoor unit LEV fully closed : Opening 41.
    - *Note 2. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit side or the BC controller or outdoor unit side. If some of the indoor units are experiencing a problem, only those indoor units that are experiencing the problem will stop. If the BC controller or the outdoor unit is experiencing a problem, all the connected units will stop.
    - *Note 3. If multiple indoor units are connected to a port and there is a discrepancy in the operation mode between the indoor unit and the port, the operation will be prohibited. (Operation mode blinks on the remote controller, the Fan stops, indoor unit LEV becomes fully closed.)

    ## (2) Outdoor unit (cooling only, heating only, cooling main and heating main modes)

    <!-- image -->

    - *Note 1. For about 3 minutes after power on, search for the indoor unit address, for the remote controller address, and for the group information will start. During this, "HO"/ "PLEASE WAIT" blinks on the display of the remote controller. When the indoor unit to be controlled by the remote controller is missing, "HO"/ "PLEASE WAIT" keeps blinking on the display of the remote controller even after 3 or more minutes after power on.

    *Note 2. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit or the outdoor unit side. The outdoor stops only when all of the connected indoor units are experiencing problems. The operation of even a single indoor unit will keep the outdoor unit running. The error will be indicated on the LED display.

    - *Note 3. The units will follow the operation mode commands from the BC controller
    - *Note 4. When the operation mode commands from the BC controllers are mixed (both cooling and heating), the actual operation mode is determined by the outdoor unit.

    Control

    ## (3) BC controller (cooling only, heating only, cooling main and heating main modes)

    Note 1. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit side or the BC controller or outdoor unit side. If some of the indoor units are experiencing a problem, only those indoor units that are experiencing the problem will stop. If the BC controller or the outdoor unit is experiencing a problem, all the connected units will stop.

    ## 5-4-2 Actions Performed in Different Modes

    ## (1) Cooling operation

    *Note 1. The indoor fan operates at the set notch under cooling mode regardless of the ON/OFF state of the thermostat.

    <!-- image -->

    ## (2) Heating operation

    <!-- image -->

    - 1) When the outdoor unit goes into the defrost mode, defrost command is sent to the BC controller and indoor units. Upon reception of the command, the indoor units will go into the defrost mode. When defrosting is completed and upon receiving the signal that indicates the completion of defrosting, indoor units will resume the heating operation.
    - 2) Defrost end condition: 10 minutes have passed since defrost operation started. Outdoor unit pipe temperature: Refer to the following page(s).[5-2-7 Defrost Operation Control](page 127)

    ## (3) Dry operation

    <!-- image -->

    *Note 1.When the indoor unit inlet temperature exceeds 18 C [64 F], the outdoor unit (compressor) and the indoor unit fan start the intermittent operation simultaneously. When the indoor unit inlet temperature becomes 18 C [64 F],or less, the fan always runs (at low speed). The outdoor unit, the indoor unit, and the solenoid valve operate in the same way as they do in the cooling operation when the compressor is turned on.

    ## 6-4 Selecting Remote Controller Functions from an ME Remote Controller

    In the remote controller function selection mode, the settings for three types of functions can be made or changed as necessary.

    - 1) Operation mode display selection mode (Display or non-display of COOL/HEAT during automatic operation mode)

    When the automatic operation mode is selected, the indoor unit will automatically perform a cooling or heating operation based on the room temperature. In this case, AUTO COOL or AUTO HEAT will appear on the remote controller display. This setting can be changed so that only AUTO will appear on the display.

    - 2) Room temperature display selection mode (Display or non-display of room temperature)

    Although the suction temperature is normally displayed on the remote controller, the setting can be changed so that it will not appear on the remote controller.

    - 3) Narrowed preset temperature range mode
    - The default temperature ranges are 67°F to 87°F in the cooling/dry mode and 63°F to 83°F in the heating mode.
    - By changing these ranges (raising the lower limit for the cooling/dry mode and lowering the upper limit for the heating mode), energy can be saved.
    - *The settable range varies depending on the unit to be connected.

    NOTE

    On the PAR-F27MEA-US model, automatic operation mode cannot be selected while the unit is in the narrowed preset temperature range mode. Only the lower limit can be set for cooling/dry mode, and upper limit for heating mode.

    It is important to have a clear understanding of the characteristics of refrigerant\
    \ and the operating characteristics of air conditioners before attempting to adjust\
    \ the refrigerant amount in a given system.\n\n- The following table shows items\
    \ of particular importance.\n- 1) During cooling operation, the amount of refrigerant\
    \ in the accumulator is the smallest when all indoor units are in operation.\n\
    - 2) During heating operation, the amount of refrigerant in the accumulator is\
    \ the largest when all indoor units are in operation.\n- 3) General tendency of\
    \ discharge temperature\n- \x8C Discharge temperature tends to rise when the system\
    \ is short on refrigerant.\n- \x8C Changing the amount of refrigerant in the system\
    \ while there is refrigerant in the accumulator has little effect on the discharge\
    \ temperature.\n- \x8C The higher the pressure, the more likely it is for the\
    \ discharge temperature to rise.\n- \x8C The lower the pressure, the more likely\
    \ it is for the discharge temperature to rise.\n- 4) When the amount of refrigerant\
    \ in the system is adequate, the compressor shell temperature is 10 to 60°C [18\
    \ to 108°F] higher than the low pressure saturation temperature (Te).\n- -> If\
    \ the temperature difference between the compressor shell temperature and low\
    \ pressure saturation temperature (Te) is smaller than 5°C [9°F], an overcharging\
    \ of refrigerant is suspected.\n\n## 6-9 Evaluating and Adjusting Refrigerant\
    \ Charge\n\n## 6-9-1 Refrigerant Overcharge and undercharge\n\nOvercharging or\
    \ undercharging of refrigerant can cause the following symptoms:\n\nBefore attempting\
    \ to adjust the amount of refrigerant in the system, thoroughly check the operating\
    \ conditions of the system. Then, adjust the refrigerant amount by running the\
    \ unit in the refrigerant amount adjust mode.\n\n| The system comes to an abnormal\
    \ stop, displaying 1500 (overcharged refrigerant) on  the controller.        \

    ## 6-9-3 The Amount of Refrigerant to Be Added

    The amount of refrigerant that is shown in the table below is factory-charged to the outdoor units. The amount necessary for extended pipe (field piping) is not included and must be added on site.

    | Outdoor unit model                                             | HP72   | HP96   |

    | Amount of pre-charged refrigerant in the outdoor unit [lbs-oz] | 26-1   | 26-1   |

    ## (1) Calculation formula

    The amount of refrigerant to be added depends on the size and the length of field piping. (unit in m[ft])

    - 1) When the piping length from outdoor unit to the farthest indoor unit is 30.5 m [100 ft] or shorter Amount of added refrigerant (kg) = (0.23 x L$\_{1}$) + (0.16 x L$\_{2}$) + (0.11 x L$\_{3}$)+ (0.2 x L$\_{4}$) + (0.12 x L$\_{5}$) + (0.06 x L$\_{6}$) + (0.024 x L$\_{7}$) + α$\_{1 }$ + α$\_{2}$ + α$\_{3}$ + α$\_{4}$ + β

    - 2) When the piping length from outdoor unit to the farthest indoor unit is longer than 30.5 m [100 ft]

    Amount of added refrigerant (kg) = (0.21 x L$\_{1}$) + (0.14 x L$\_{2}$) + (0.1 x L$\_{3}$)+ (0.18 x L$\_{4}$) + (0.11 x L$\_{5}$) + (0.054 x L$\_{6}$) + (0.021 x L$\_{7}$) + α$\_{1 }$ + α$\_{2}$ + α$\_{3}$ + α$\_{4}$ + β

    ## 6-9-4 Refrigerant Charge Adjustment Mode

    Follow the procedures below to add or extract refrigerant as necessary depending on the operation mode.

    When the function switch (SW4 (922)) on the main board on the outdoor unit (OC only) is turned to ON, the unit goes into the refrigerant amount adjust mode, and the following sequence is followed.

- doc_name: a26f32
  offset: 480357
  qa_pairs:
  - answer: The switch on the OS should not be set to ON when adjusting the refrigerant
      amount.
    question: When adjusting the refrigerant amount, what should be the state of the
      switch on the OS?
  - answer: During refrigerant amount adjustment, the LEV on the indoor unit does
      not open as fully as it normally does during cooling operation.
    question: During refrigerant amount adjustment, how does the LEV on the indoor
      unit behave differently compared to normal cooling operation?
  - answer: The values of TH4, SC11, SC16, and Tc should be checked to adjust the
      refrigerant amount.
    question: What values should be checked to adjust the refrigerant amount?
  - answer: The subcool (SC11 and SC16) of the BC controller should be 5°C or above,
      and the superheat on the indoor unit should be between 5 and 15°C.
    question: What conditions indicate that the refrigerant amount is adequate after
      adjustment?
  - answer: The high pressure must be at least 2.0MPa to enable a proper adjustment
      of refrigerant amount.
    question: What is the minimum high pressure required to enable a proper refrigerant
      amount adjustment?
  text: "The unit will not go into the refrigerant amount adjust mode when the switch\

    \ amount adjust mode, the LEV on the indoor unit does not open as fully as it\
    \ normally does during cooling operation to secure subcooling.\n\n- 1) Adjust\
    \ the refrigerant amount based on the values of TH4, SC11, SC16, and Tc, following\
    \ the flowchart below. The TH4, SC11, SC16, and Tc values can be displayed by\
    \ using the self-diagnosis switch (SW4 (SW6-10: OFF)) on the control board of\
    \ the OC or OS.\n- 2) There may be cases when the refrigerant amount may seem\
    \ adequate for a short while after starting the unit in the refrigerant amount\
    \ adjust mode but turn out to be inadequate later on (when the refrigerant system\
    \ stabilizes).\n\n## When the amount of refrigerant is truly adequate.\n\nSubcool\
    \ (SC11 and SC16) of the BC controller is 5°C [9°F] or above and SH on the indoor\

    \ adequate at the moment, but may turn out to be inadequate later on.\n\nSubcool\
    \ (SC11 and SC16) of the BC controller is 5°C [9°F] or less and SH on the indoor\
    \ unit is 5°C [9°F] or less. Wait until the Subcool (SC11 and SC16) of the BC\
    \ controller reaches 5°C [9°F] or above and the SH of the indoor unit is between\
    \ 5 and 15°C [9 and 27°F] to determine that the refrigerant amount is adequate.\n\
    \n\x8C SC11: Subcool of liquid refrigerant at BC controller inlet; SC16: Subcool\
    \ of liquid refrigerant at BC controller outlet\n\n- 3) High pressure must be\
    \ at least 2.0MPa [290psi] to enable a proper adjustment of refrigerant amount\
    \ to be made.\n- 4) Refrigerant amount adjust mode automatically ends 90 minutes\
    \ after beginning. When this happens, by turning off the SW4 (922) and turning\
    \ them back on, the unit will go back into the refrigerant amount adjust mode.\n\

  - answer: After an hour of cooling with the auto vane in the vertical position,
      it may automatically move to the horizontal position.
    question: Why does the auto vane sometimes move to a horizontal position after
      cooling?
  - answer: The fan speed changes from very low when 'Thermo-OFF' to a preset speed
      when 'Thermo-ON', depending on the pipe temperature.
    question: What causes the fan speed to change during heating?
  - answer: If the auxiliary heater is on, the fan will run for one minute after stopping
      to dissipate heat.
    question: Why might the fan continue to run after the unit has been turned off?
  - answer: The fan will operate at an extra low speed for 5 minutes or until the
      pipe temperature reaches 35°C, then at low speed for 2 minutes, before reaching
      the set speed.
    question: What is the expected behavior of the fan speed when the unit is first
      turned on?
  - answer: The drain pump may run for three minutes after the unit stops in cooling
      mode or when drain water is detected.

  - answer: Yes, the noise during mode switching is normal due to refrigerant circuit
      reversal.
    question: Is it normal for the system to make noise when switching between cooling
      and heating?
  - answer: That sound is normal and caused by temporary instability in the refrigerant
      flow.
    question: Why might I hear refrigerant flowing in the indoor unit right after
      starting?
  - answer: It's normal; the LEVs are slightly open to prevent refrigerant accumulation
      in the compressor.
    question: Why might warm air come from indoor units not set to heating mode?
  - answer: The standard indoor temperature for cooling tests is 26.7°C/19.4°C and
      the outdoor temperature is 35°C.
    question: What are the standard indoor and outdoor temperatures for cooling tests?
  - answer: The standard indoor temperature for heating tests is 21.1°C and the outdoor
      temperature is 8.3°C/6.1°C.

  - answer: You should determine if the model has a drain sensor or a float switch,
      as the troubleshooting steps differ.
    question: If I encounter error code 2500, what should I consider?
  - answer: The troubleshooting steps depend on whether the unit is a TKMU or YKMU
      model.
    question: For error code 4102, what is the key difference in troubleshooting?
  - answer: You need to know the detail code, which could be 108, 109, or 110, and
      also whether the model is TKMU or YKMU.
    question: When dealing with error codes 4220 or 4225, what additional information
      is needed?
  - answer: No, the solutions differ depending on whether the model uses a drain sensor
      or a float switch.

  - answer: Error code 103 indicates a DCCT overcurrent, detected by hardware.
    question: What does error code 103 indicate?
  - answer: Overcurrent errors can be caused by a short-circuited motor, instantaneous
      overcurrent detected by software, or an overcurrent effective value detected
      by software.
    question: What are some potential causes of an overcurrent error?
  - answer: Error code 5101 indicates a temperature sensor fault.
    question: If I see error code 5101, what type of fault is indicated?

    ## 7-3-3 Error Code [1302] (during operation)

    ## 1. Error code definition

    High pressure fault 1 (Outdoor unit)

    ## 2. Error definition and error detection method

    - 1) If the pressure of 3.78MPa [548psi] or higher is detected by the pressure sensor during operation (the first detection), the outdoor stops once, turns to antirestart mode for 3 minutes, and restarts after 3 minutes automatically.
    - 2) If the pressure of 3.78MPa [548psi] or higher is detected by the pressure sensor again (the second detection) within 30 minutes after the first stop of the outdoor unit, the outdoor unit stops once, turns to anti-restart mode for 3 minutes, and restarts after 3 minutes automatically.
    - 3) If the pressure of 3.87MPa [561psi] or higher is detected by the pressure sensor (the third detection) within 30 minutes of the second stop of the outdoor unit, the outdoor unit will make an error stop, and the error code "1302" will be displayed.
    - 4) If the pressure of 3.78MPa [548psi] or higher is detected more than 30 minutes after the stop of the outdoor unit, the detection is regarded as the first detection, and the operation described in step 1 above will start.
    - 5) For 30 minutes after the stop of the outdoor unit, preliminary errors will be displayed on the LED display.
    - 6) The outdoor unit makes an error stop immediately when not only the pressure sensor but also the pressure switch detects 4.15$^{+0,-0.15}$ MPa [601$^{+0,-22}$ psi]

    \ The immersion of sensor tip in water is detected by the ON/OFF signal from the\
    \ float switch.\n- ∗ Submergence of the sensor\n- When it is detected that the\
    \ float switch has been ON for 15 seconds, it is interpreted that the sensor tip\
    \ is immersed in water.\n- ∗ Sensor in the air\n- When it is detected that the\
    \ float switch has been OFF for 15 seconds, it is interpreted that the sensor\
    \ tip is not immersed in water.\n- 2) If it is detected that the float switch\
    \ has been ON for 3 minutes after the immersion of the sensor tip was detected,\
    \ this is considered a drain pump failure, and \"2502\" appears on the monitor.\n\
    - ∗ The total time it takes for this error to be detected is 3 minutes and 15\
    \ seconds, including the time it takes for the first immersion of the sensor tip\
    \ to be detected.\n- 3) Detection of drain pump failure is performed while the\
    \ unit is stopped.\n- 4) The following criteria are met when the criteria for\
    \ the forced stoppage of outdoor unit (system stoppage) are met.\n- ∗ \"Liquid\
    \ pipe temperature - inlet temperature - 10°C [ -18°F] \" has been detected for\
    \ 30 minutes.\n- It is detected by the float switch that the sensor tip has been\
    \ immersed in water for 15 minutes or more.\n- ∗ The conditions that are listed\
    \ under items 1) through 3) above are always met before the criteria for the forced\
    \ stoppage of the outdoor unit.\n- 5) The indoor unit that detected the conditions\
    \ that are listed in item 4) above brings the outdoor unit in the same refrigerant\
    \ circuit to an error stop (compressor operation prohibited), and the outdoor\
    \ unit brings all the indoor units in the same refrigerant circuit that are in\
    \ any mode other than Fan or Stop to an error stop.\n- 6) Forced stoppage of the\
    \ outdoor unit\n- Detection timing: The error is detected whether the unit is\
    \ in operation or stopped.\n- This error is detected whether the unit is in operation\
    \ or stopped.\n- 7) Ending criteria for the forced stoppage of outdoor unit\n\
    - Power reset the indoor unit that was identified as the error source and the\
    \ outdoor unit that is connected to the same refrigerant circuit.\n- Forced stoppage\
    \ of the outdoor unit cannot be cancelled by stopping the unit via the remote\
    \ controller.\n- (Note) Items 1) - 3) and 4) - 7) are detected independently from\
    \ each other.\n\nThe address and attribute that appear on the remote controller\
    \ are those of the indoor unit (or OA processing unit) that caused the error.\n\

      or more at startup to trigger the error.
    question: What is the critical temperature threshold for a heatsink overheat error
      during startup?
  - answer: The outdoor unit enters anti-restart mode for 3 minutes, then either restarts
      normally if the error is resolved or stops if the error persists.
    question: What happens if a temperature sensor reports a short or open circuit?
  - answer: A gas-side sensor error cannot be detected during heating operation or
      during cooling operation for the first 3 minutes after the compressor starts.
    question: Under what conditions is a gas-side temperature sensor error undetectable?
  - answer: A thermistor should read approximately 6.4 kΩ at 20°C.
    question: What resistance should a thermistor read at 20°C?
  - answer: The outdoor unit stops, enters anti-restart mode for 3 minutes, and then
      restarts if the detected temperature is within the normal range.

  - answer: Check for a disconnection or shutdown of the power source of the transmission
      line's power supply unit.
    question: What should I check first if the central control transmission line voltage
      is below 20V?
  - answer: It indicates a 'No ACK' error, meaning no acknowledgement signal was received
      after a transmission.
    question: What does error code 6607 indicate?
  - answer: Turn off the power to the LOSSNAY unit and then turn it back on.
    question: If a LOSSNAY unit is showing a 'No ACK' error, what is the first troubleshooting
      step I should take?
  - answer: Potential causes include a shut-off power source, an address change during
      operation, faulty wiring, or a disconnected connector.
    question: What might cause a 'No ACK' error after the initial troubleshooting
      step?
  - answer: The error is detected when no acknowledgement signal is received after
      a transmission, for example, after six consecutive transmissions with 30-second
      intervals.

  - answer: Four or more indoor units can be connected to the same port.
    question: What is the rule when connecting multiple indoor units to the same port?
  - answer: The port with the smaller number should not be connected to the indoor
      unit.
    question: When using two ports, which port should not be connected to an indoor
      unit?
  - answer: The address of the BC controller (Sub 1 or 2) is not added to the smallest
      indoor unit address.
    question: When using two ports, how is the BC controller address handled?
  - answer: The indoor unit addresses connected to each BC controller (main, Sub1,
      and Sub2) are not set as described for single BC controller systems.
    question: In a system with multiple BC controllers, how are indoor unit addresses
      set?
  - answer: The indoor unit addresses connected to the BC controllers are not set
      as they would be in a system with a single BC controller.
    question: If a system has multiple BC controllers, how are the indoor units addressed?

      control line and the voltage is not between 10V and 30V?
  - answer: When MELANS is connected to the system.
    question: When is the male power supply connector connected to the female power
      supply switch connector for centralized control?
  - answer: The voltage should be between 10V and 30V.
    question: What is the expected voltage range on the transmission line for centralized
      control when multiple outdoor units are connected?
  - answer: The provided information does not specify the exact cause. However, it
      indicates that a check should be performed when cooling operation starts with
      the normal remote controller display, but the capacity is not enough.

  - answer: Faulty pressure sensor detection, high discharge temperature, high pressure,
      or excessive pressure drops.
    question: What could cause the compressor frequency to not increase sufficiently?
  - answer: Check the pressure difference between the detected pressure and the actual
      pressure, and if inaccurate, check the sensor.
    question: If the pressure sensor is suspected to be faulty, what should be done?
  - answer: It can cause insufficient capacity.
    question: What is a potential consequence of the low pressure sensor reading lower
      than the actual pressure?
  - answer: High discharge temperature or high pressure can prevent the compressor
      frequency from rising.
    question: Under what conditions might the compressor frequency not rise even with
      a higher Te than Tem?
  - answer: High discharge temperature or high pressure can also cause this issue.
    question: Besides a faulty sensor, what other conditions can cause the compressor
      frequency to not rise sufficiently?

      section?
  - answer: Insufficient refrigerant amount.
    question: What is the likely cause if the compressor frequency does not increase
      and the discharge temperature is low?
  - answer: Check for compressor failure.
    question: Besides checking the discharge temperature, what else should be checked
      when a refrigerant recovery operation is likely to start?
  - answer: A blockage in the liquid pipe or a pressure loss slowing refrigerant flow.
    question: What could cause a rise in discharge temperature due to a drop in low
      pressure?
  - answer: It is not specified in the text, only that the outdoor unit stops at times
      during operation.
    question: What is one of the conditions that can lead to outdoor unit stopping
      at irregular times?

  - answer: Noise interference on the transmission line.
    question: What is the primary cause of communication errors between the indoor
      and outdoor units?
  - answer: Address overlap, transmission processor hardware error, no acknowledgement,
      and transmission line bus busy error.
    question: What are some symptoms that indicate noise interference on the transmission
      line?
  - answer: Logic 0 should be 2.5V or higher, and logic 1 should be 1.3V or below.
    question: What voltage levels should be expected on the transmission line for
      logic 0 and logic 1?
  - answer: They should check the wave pattern of the transmission line with an oscilloscope.
    question: What should a technician check if they observe errors related to noise
      on the transmission line?
  - answer: No, minute noise around 1V can be generated by the DC-DC converter or
      inverter operation and is not a problem if the transmission line shield is grounded.
    question: Is a small amount of noise on the transmission signal always a problem?
  text: |
    Control is performed by exchanging signals between the outdoor unit and the indoor unit (ME remote controller) through MNET transmission. Noise interference on the transmission line will interrupt the normal transmission, leading to erroneous operation.

    ## (1) Symptoms caused by noise interference on the transmission line

    | Cause                                        | Erroneous operation                                                                                                                 | Error code   | Error code definition                     |
    |----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Signal is transformed and will be misjudged as the  signal of another address.                                                      | 6600         | Address overlap                           |
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission wave pattern is transformed due to  the noise creating a new signal                                                    | 6602         | Transmission pro- cessor hardware er- ror |
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission wave pattern is transformed due to  the noise, and will not be received normally leading  to no acknowledgement (ACK). | 6607         | No ACK error                              |
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission cannot be performed due to the fine  noise.                                                                            | 6603         | Transmission line  bus busy error         |
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission is successful; however, the acknowl- edgement (ACK) or the response cannot be re- ceived normally due to the noise.    | 6607 6608    | No ACK error No response error            |

    ## (2) Wave shape check

    <!-- image -->

    ## Wave shape check

    Check the wave pattern of the transmission line with an oscilloscope. The following conditions must be met.

    - 1) Small wave pattern (noise) must not exist on the transmission signal. (Minute noise (approximately 1V) can be generated by DC-DC converter or the inverter operation; however, such noise is not a problem when the shield of the transmission line is grounded.)
    - 2) The sectional voltage level of transmission signal should be as follows.

    |   Logic | Voltage level of the transmission line   |
    |---------|------------------------------------------|
    |       0 | V$\_{HL}$ = 2.5V or higher                |
    |       1 | V$\_{BN}$ = 1.3V or below                 |

    ## (3) Check method and remedy

    ## 1) Measures against noise

    Check the followings when noise exists on the wave or the errors described in (1) occur.

    \ Conducts electricity between the oil separator outlet and heat exchanger AND\
    \ the gas ball valve (BV1) and the accumulator to complete the circuit for the\
    \ cooling cycle. When powered: The electricity runs between the oil separator\
    \ and the gas ball valve, and between the heat exchanger and the accumulator.\
    \ This circulation is for heating.\n\nCheck the LED display and the intake and\
    \ the discharge temperature for the 4-way valve to check whether the valve has\
    \ no faults and the electricity runs between where and where.Do not touch the\
    \ pipe when checking the temperature, as the pipe on the oil separator side will\
    \ be hot.\n\nDo not give an impact from outside, as the outer hull will be deformed\
    \ leading to the malfunction of the inner valve.\n\n## (2) In case of SV1a (Bypass\
    \ valve)\n\nThis solenoid valve opens when powered (Relay ON).\n\n- 1) At compressor\
    \ start-up, the SV1a turns on for 4 minutes, and the operation can be checked\
    \ by the self-diagnosis LED display and the closing sound.\n- 2) To check whether\
    \ the valve is open or closed, check the change of the SV1a downstream piping\
    \ temperature while the valve is being powered.Even when the valve is closed,\
    \ high-temperature refrigerant flows inside the capillary next to the valve. (Therefore,\

  - answer: The bypass valve (SV9) opens when the system is in Heating-only or Heating-main
      operation at the minimum frequency, and the value of 63HS1 is greater than 3.5
      MPa.
    question: Under what conditions does the bypass valve (SV9) activate?
  - answer: You can determine if a solenoid valve is open by measuring and monitoring
      the temperature change on the downstream pipe while the unit is energized. A
      temperature increase indicates that the valve is open.
    question: How can I determine if a solenoid valve (SV5b, SV9, SV10, or SV11) is
      open?
  - answer: If the outdoor fan is not rotating or vibrating, a problem with the fan
      board or the fan motor is suspected. Disconnect the motor wire from the fan
      board before checking.
    question: What should I do if the outdoor fan is not rotating or is vibrating?
  - answer: The outdoor fan's full speed is approximately 680 rpm for the HP72 model
      and 790 rpm for the HP96 model.

    LEV are stepping-motor-driven valves that operate by receiving the pulse signals from the indoor and outdoor unit control boards.

    ## (1) Outdoor LEV (LEV5a, LEV4), Indoor LEV and BC controller LEV

    The valve opening changes according to the number of pulses.

    - 1) Control boards and the LEV (Indoor unit LEV, and BC controller LEV1 (G type only) and LEV3)

    Outdoor control board

    Note. The connector numbers on the intermediate connector and the connector on the control board differ. Check the color of the lead wire to judge the number.

    <!-- image -->

    - 2) Control boards and the LEV (BC controller LEV1 (Applicable only to the GA and HA types.))

    <!-- image -->

    ## 3) Pulse signal output and valve operation

    | Output  (phase)  number   | Output state   | Output state   | Output state   | Output state   |
    |---------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
    | Output  (phase)  number   | 1              | 2              | 3              | 4              |
    | 1                         |                |                |                | ON OFF OFF ON  |
    | 2                         |                |                |                | ON ON OFF OFF  |
    | 3                         |                |                |                | OFF ON ON OFF  |
    | 4                         |                |                |                | OFF OFF ON ON  |

    Output pulses change in the following orders when the

    Valve is closed; 1 2 3 4 1 Valve is open; 4 3 2 1 4

    - *1. When the LEV opening angle does not change, all the output phases will be off.
    - *2. When the output is open phase or remains ON, the motor cannot run smoothly, and rattles and vibrates.

    ## 4) LEV valve closing and opening operation

    *When the power is turned on, the valve closing signal of 2200 pulses will be output from the indoor board to LEV to fix the valve position. It must be fixed at point A.

    When the valve operates smoothly, no sound from LEV or no vibration occurs, however, when the pulses change from E to A in the chart or the valve is locked, a big sound occurs.

    *Whether a sound is generated or not can be determined by holding a screwdriver against it, then placing your ear against the handle.

    \n## 8-10-1 Inverter-Related Problems and Solutions\n\n- \x8C Replace only the\
    \ compressor if only the compressor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent will\
    \ flow through the inverter if the compressor is damaged, however, the power supply\
    \ is automatically cut when overcurrent is detected, protecting the inverter from\
    \ damage.)\n- \x8C Replace only the fan motor if only the fan motor is found to\
    \ be defective. (Overcurrent will flow through the inverter if the fan motor is\
    \ damaged, however, the power supply is automatically cut when overcurrrent is\
    \ detected, protecting the inverter from damage.)\n- \x8C Replace the defective\
    \ components if the inverter is found to be defective.\n- \x8C If both the compressor\
    \ and the inverter are found to be defective, replace the defective component(s)\
    \ of both devices.\n\n## (1) Inverter-related problems: Troubleshooting and remedies\n\
    \n- 1) The INV board has a large-capacity electrolytic capacitor, in which residual\
    \ voltage remains even after the main power is turned off, posing a risk of electric\
    \ shock. Before inspecting the inverter-related items, turn off the main power,\
    \ wait for 5 to 10 minutes, and confirm that the voltage at both ends of the electrolytic\
    \ capacitor has dropped to a sufficiently low level.\n- 2) Disconnect the outdoor\
    \ unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. (To plug\
    \ or unplugconnectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that\
    \ the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor\
    \ may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates\
    \ in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.)\n- 3) To connect\
    \ wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.\n- 4) Reconnect the\
    \ connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.\n-\
    \ 5) The IPM on the inverter becomes damaged if there are loose screws are connectors.\
    \ If a problem occurs after replacing some of the parts, mixed up wiring is often\
    \ the cause of the problem. Check for proper connection of the wiring, screws,\
    \ connectors, and Faston terminals.\n- 6) To avoid damage to the circuit board,\
    \ do not connect or disconnect the inverter-related connectors with the main power\
    \ turned on.\n- 7) Current sensors become damaged if electricity is passed through\
    \ without them being connected to the circuit board. Connect the current sensor\
    \ to the appropriate connectors on the circuit board before operating the inverter.\n\
    - 8) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the terminals are securely\
    \ locked in place after insertion.\n\n"

  - answer: Apply a thin, even layer of heat radiation grease.
    question: What should be applied when replacing the IPM, diode stack, or IGBT?
  - answer: Wipe it off to prevent contact failure.
    question: What should you do with any grease that gets on the wiring terminal?
  - answer: It can damage the compressor.
    question: What damage can faulty wiring cause to the compressor?
  - answer: Measure the insulation resistance of the compressor.
    question: What should be measured before connecting the power to the compressor?
  - answer: Connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power.
    question: What is the next step if the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below?

    - 9) When the IPM, diode stack, or IGBT is replaced, apply a thin layer of heat radiation grease that is supplied evenly to these parts. Wipe off any grease that may get on the wiring terminal to avoid terminal contact failure.
    - 10) Faulty wiring to the compressor damages the compressor. Connect the wiring in the correct phase sequence.
    - 11) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. (The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.)

  - answer: Turn off the power to the unit and ensure the electrolytic capacitor voltage
      is below 20 VDC.
    question: Before removing parts from the control box for inspection, what is the
      required first step?
  - answer: The resistance should be 22 ohms, with a tolerance of plus or minus 10%.
    question: When measuring the resistance of the Intelligent Power Module (IPM),
      what is the acceptable range between the diode stack's positive terminal and
      terminal TB31?
  - answer: The polarity should be checked, and it should be verified that the resistance
      is neither open nor shorted.
    question: When troubleshooting the Intelligent Power Module (IPM), what should
      be verified before taking measurements with a tester?
  - answer: A dry-battery-powered tester with an internal power source of 1.5V or
      greater is recommended because button-battery-powered testers may not provide
      accurate readings due to low voltage.
    question: What type of tester is recommended for measuring the resistance of the
      IPM and why?
  - answer: A result that is more than double or less than half the expected value
      at the same measurement point is not allowed.
    question: When measuring resistance between IPM terminals, what is considered
      an unacceptable result?

    \ Inverter-Related Problems and Solutions\n\n- \x8C Replace only the compressor\
    \ if only the compressor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent will flow through\
    \ the inverter if the compressor is damaged, however, the power supply is automatically\
    \ cut when overcurrent is detected, protecting the inverter from damage.)\n- \x8C\
    \ Replace only the fan motor if only the fan motor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent\
    \ will flow through the inverter if the fan motor is damaged, however, the power\
    \ supply is automatically cut when overcurrrent is detected, protecting the inverter\
    \ from damage.)\n- \x8C Replace the defective components if the inverter is found\
    \ to be defective.\n- \x8C If both the compressor and the inverter are found to\
    \ be defective, replace the defective component(s) of both devices.\n\n## (1)\
    \ Inverter-related problems: Troubleshooting and remedies\n\n- 1) The INV board\
    \ has a large-capacity electrolytic capacitor, in which residual voltage remains\
    \ even after the main power is turned off, posing a risk of electric shock. Turn\
    \ off the unit, leave it turned off for at least 10 minutes, and check that the\
    \ voltage across FT-P and FT-N terminals on the INV board or the terminals at\
    \ both ends of the electrolytic capacitor is 20V or below before checking inside\
    \ the control box.\n- (It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after\
    \ the power supply is turn off.)\n- 2) Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector\
    \ (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. (To plug or unplugconnectors, check\
    \ that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor\
    \ in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and\
    \ cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions.\
    \ Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.)\n- 3) To connect wiring to TB7,\
    \ check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.\n- 4) Reconnect the connector (CNINV)\
    \ to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.\n- 5) The IPM on the\
    \ inverter becomes damaged if there are loose screws are connectors. If a problem\
    \ occurs after replacing some of the parts, mixed up wiring is often the cause\
    \ of the problem. Check for proper connection of the wiring, screws, connectors,\
    \ and Faston terminals.\n- 6) To avoid damage to the circuit board, do not connect\
    \ or disconnect the inverter-related connectors with the main power turned on.\n\
    - 7) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the terminals are securely\
    \ locked in place after insertion.\n\nPress the tab on the terminals to remove\
    \ them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 8) When the IPM or IGBT is replaced, apply a thin\
    \ layer of heat radiation grease that is supplied evenly to these parts. Wipe\
    \ off any grease that may get on the wiring terminal to avoid terminal contact\
    \ failure.\n"

  - answer: Disconnect the power supply wires, measure the compressor's insulation
      resistance, and check for a ground fault.
    question: What should be done if the compressor is energized when it is not supposed
      to be?
  - answer: Connect all power supply wires and turn on the power to the outdoor unit
      to evaporate the liquid refrigerant.
    question: What is the next step if the compressor's insulation resistance is below
      1.0 M Ω?
  - answer: Implement solutions that correspond to the specific error codes.
    question: What should a technician do if they encounter inverter-related errors
      with codes such as 4250 or 5301?
  - answer: Refer to the section that provides solutions for main breaker trips.
    question: If the main power breaker trips, what should be the next step?
  - answer: Check the inverter frequency on the LED monitor, and if the frequency
      indicates operation, refer to the section on checking the inverter for damage
      during compressor operation.
    question: What should be checked if the compressor is not operating but the system
      indicates it is?

    - 9) Faulty wiring to the compressor damages the compressor. Connect the wiring in the correct phase sequence.
    - 10) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. (The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.)

    ## 8-11-5 Checking the Inverter for Damage during Compressor Operation

- doc_name: a26f32
  offset: 1056702
  qa_pairs:
  - answer: Check for problems in items 8-11-2 through 8-11-4, ensure high and low
      pressures are balanced, verify no liquid refrigerant is in the compressor, and
      check the belt heater. Also, confirm a pressure difference after startup; if
      not, the compressor may be locked.
    question: What should be checked if overcurrent problems occur immediately after
      the compressor starts?
  - answer: If the voltage imbalance is greater than 5% or 5V, replace the INV board.
      If there is no voltage imbalance, check the belt heater. Liquid refrigerant
      in the compressor may be a cause.
    question: What action should be taken if there's a voltage imbalance after the
      inverter output voltage stabilizes?
  - answer: A fan motor insulation resistance of less than 1 MΩ indicates a failure.
    question: What indicates a fan motor insulation failure?
  - answer: A normal coil resistance for a fan motor is a few ohms, but this value
      changes with temperature.
    question: What is a typical coil resistance for a fan motor?
  - answer: Replace the fan motor.
    question: What should be done if a fan motor has failed?

  qa_pairs:
  - answer: First, check if the fan motor is locked. If it is, replace the motor.
      If the error persists, replace the INV board. If the motor isn't locked, further
      checks are needed.
    question: What should I do if the unit stops within 10 seconds with an electrical
      overload or position detection error?
  - answer: Replace the Fan board, and if the same error occurs after restarting,
      replace it again.
    question: If I get an RPM error before startup, what is the recommended action?
  - answer: First, check for gusts or windy conditions. If wind is not the cause,
      further checks are needed and if no issues are found, replace the Fan board.
      If the issue remains, replace the fan motor.
    question: What steps should I take if there's an electrical current overload error
      during operation?
  - answer: First, check for gusts or windy conditions. If it is not windy, then replace
      the Fan board.

    \ DIP SW 4-1 through 4-10 (Set SW6-10 to OFF.)(Switch number 10 is represented\
    \ by 0), the operating condition of the unit can be monitored on the service monitor.\
    \ (Refer to the table on the following pages for DIP SW settings.) The service\
    \ monitor uses 4-digit 7-segment LED to display numerical values and other types\
    \ of information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\x8C SW4-10 is set to\
    \ \"0\" on the LED Status Indicators Table.\n\n\x8C In the example above, 1 through\
    \ 9 are set to OFF, and 10 is set to ON.\n\nPressure and temperature are examples\
    \ of numerical values, and operating conditions and the on-off status of solenoid\
    \ valve are examples of flag display.\n\n- 1) Display of numerical values\n\n\
    Example: When the pressure data sensor reads 18.8kg/cm$^{2}$ (Item No. 58)\n\n\
    - \x8C The unit of pressure is in kg/cm 2\n- \x8C Use the following conversion\
    \ formula to convert the displayed value into a value in SI unit.\n\nValue in\
    \ SI unit (MPa) = Displayed value (kg/cm$^{2}$) x 0.098\n\n- 2) Flag display\n\
    \nExample: When 21S4a and SV1a are ON. (Item No. 3)\n\nExample: 3-minutes restart\
    \ mode (Item No. 14)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\
    ## 9-1-2 Initial LED Display\n\nFrom power on until the completion of initial\
    \ settings, the following information will be displayed on the monitor screen.\

  - answer: It uses an internal timer that is set by a system controller.
    question: How does the outdoor unit keep track of time?
  - answer: The clock stops, and when power is restored, it resumes from where it
      left off, potentially showing an incorrect time.
    question: What happens to the clock if the outdoor unit loses power?
  - answer: A connected system controller updates the time automatically once a day.
    question: How does the system correct the time if it's incorrect?
  - answer: It displays the elapsed time and days since the first power on.
    question: What does the service LED display when a system controller is not connected?
  - answer: It displays the current date and time.

  text: "## 9-1-3 Clock Memory Function\n\nThe outdoor unit has a simple clock function\
    \ that enables the unit to calculate the current time with an internal timer by\
    \ receiving the time set by the system controller, such as AG-150A.\n\nIf an error\
    \ (including a preliminary error) occurs, the error history data and the error\
    \ detection time are stored into the service memory.\n\nThe error detection time\
    \ stored in the service memory and the current time can be seen on the service\
    \ LED.\n\n- 1) Use the time displayed on the service LED as a reference.\n- 2)\
    \ The date and the time are set to \"00\" by default. If a system controller that\
    \ sets the time, such as AG-150A is not connected, the elapsed time and days since\
    \ the first power on will be displayed.\n- If the time set on a system controller\
    \ is received, the count will start from the set date and the time.\n- 3) The\
    \ time is not updated while the power of the indoor unit is turned off. When the\
    \ power is turned off and then on again, the count will resume from the time before\
    \ the power was turned off. Thus, the time that differs the actual time will be\
    \ displayed. (This also applies when a power failure occurs.)\n- The system controller,\
    \ such as AG-150A, adjusts the time once a day. When the system controller is\
    \ connected, the time will be automatically updated to the correct current time\
    \ after the time set by the system controller is received. (The data stored into\
    \ the memory before the set time is received will not be updated.)\n- (1) Reading\
    \ the time data:\n- 1) Time display\n\nExample: 12 past 9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\
    - * Disappears if the time data is deviated due to a power failure, or if a system\
    \ controller that sets the time is not connected.\n- 2) Date display\n\n\x8C When\
    \ the main controller that can set the time is connected Example: May 10, 2003\n\
    \n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Appears between the year and the month, and nothing appears\
    \ when the date is displayed.\n\n\x8C When the main controller that can set the\
    \ time is not connected Example: 52 days after power was turned on\n\n<!-- image\

  - answer: SW4 relates to indoor unit checks, operation modes, and status displays.
    question: What is the significance of SW4 when SW6-10 is set to OFF?
  - answer: The 'point' column indicates a specific check or status related to the
      indoor unit.
    question: What does the 'point' column represent in the context of SW4?
  - answer: The 'status' column likely shows a different aspect of the indoor unit's
      condition or operational state compared to the 'point' column.
    question: What is the difference between the 'status' column and the 'point' column?
  - answer: The note *1 indicates that either the condition of OC or OS can be displayed
      individually, or the condition of the entire refrigerant system can be displayed.
    question: What does the note '*1' refer to regarding the displayed condition?
  - answer: The checks performed on the indoor unit include 'Bottom' and 'Top' checks.
    question: What kind of checks are performed on the indoor unit?
