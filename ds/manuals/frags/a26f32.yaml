    \ the risk of shorting, current leakage, electric shock, malfunctions, smoke,\
    \ or fire, do not splash water on electric parts.\n\nTo reduce the risk of electric\
    \ shock, malfunctions, smoke or fire, do not operate the switches/buttons or touch\
    \ other electrical parts with wet hands.\n\nTo reduce the risk of pipe burst and\
    \ explosion, do not allow gas refrigerant and refrigerant oil to be trapped in\
    \ the refrigerant circuit.\n\nTo reduce the risk of burns or frost bites, do not\
    \ touch the refrigerant pipes or refrigerant circuit components with bare hands\
    \ during and immediately after operation.\n\nTo reduce the risk of burns, do not\
    \ touch any electrical parts with bare hands during or immediately after stopping\
    \ operation.\n\nTo reduce the risk of injury from falling tools, keep children\
    \ away while installing, inspecting, or repairing the unit.\n\nKeep the space\
    \ well ventilated. Refrigerant can displace air and cause oxygen starvation. If\
    \ leaked refrigerant comes in contact with a heat source, toxic gas may be generated.\n\
    \nAlways replace a fuse with one with the correct current rating. The use of improperly\
    \ rated fuses or a substitution of fuses with steel or copper wire may result\
    \ in bursting, fire or explosion.\n\nTo reduce the risk of electric shock, smoke,\
    \ and fire due to infiltration of dust and water, properly install all required\
    \ covers.\n\nTo reduce the risk of electric shock, smoke, and fire due to infiltration\
    \ of dust and water, properly install all required terminal block covers and insulation\
    \ sheets.\n\nTo reduce the risk of fire or explosion, do not place flammable materials\
    \ or use flammable sprays around the unit.\n\nTo reduce the risk of being caught\
    \ in rotating parts, electric shock, and burns, do not operate the unit without\
    \ all required panels and guards being installed.\n\nTo reduce the risk of injury,\
    \ do not sit, stand, or place objects on the unit.\n\nThe unit described in this\
    \ manual is not intended for use with food, animals, plants, precision instruments,\

    To reduce the risk of wire shorting, electric shock, malfunctions, or fire, keep circuit boards dust free, and do not touch them with your hands or tools.

    [7] AdditionalPrecautions

    ## Additional Precautions

    To avoid damage to the unit, use appropriate tools to install, inspect, or repair the unit.

    Use properly rated breakers and fuses (inverter circuit breaker, local switch <switch + fuse>, no-fuse breaker). The use of a breaker with a breaking capacity greater than the specified capacity may cause electric shock, malfunctions, smoke, or fire. (Applicable to inverter units only)

    To reduce the risk of current leakage, overheating, smoke, or fire, use properly rated cables with adequate current carrying capacity.

    Proper grounding must be provided by a licensed electrician.

    Do not connect the grounding wire to a gas pipe, water pipe, lightning rod, or telephone wire. Improper grounding may result in electric shock, smoke, fire, or malfunction due to electrical noise interference.

    To reduce the risk of wire shorting, electric leak, electric shock, smoke, or fire, do not perform maintenance work in the rain.

    To reduce the risk of injury, electric shock, and fire, properly reinstall all removed components after completing repair work.

    To reduce the risk of refrigerant and water leakage, check the pipe supports and insulation for damage during inspection or repair, and replace or repair the ones that are found to be deteriorated.

    To reduce the risk or malfunction, turn on the power at least 12 hours before starting operation, and leave the power turned on throughout the operating season.

    Recover all refrigerant in the units, and dispose of it properly according to any applicable laws and regulations.

    To reduce the risk of deterioration of refrigerant oil and compressor malfunctions caused by a refrigerant that contains chloride, such as R22, only use R410A.

    Provide a maintenance access to allow for the inspection of pipes above the ceiling or the buried pipes.

    Take appropriate measures against electrical noise interference when installing the air conditioners in hospitals or facilities with radio communication capabilities. Inverter, high-frequency medical, or wireless communication equipment as well as power generators may cause the air conditioning system to malfunction. Air conditioning system may also adversely affect the operation of these types of equipment by creating electrical noise.

    To reduce the risk of damage to the unit, leave the valves on the unit closed until refrigerant charging is completed.

    Place a wet towel on the refrigerant service valve before brazing the pipes to keep its temperature from rising above 120ºC and damaging the surrounding equipment.

    Direct the blazing torch flame away from the adjacent cables and sheet metal to keep them from being overheated and damaged.

    Prepare tools for exclusive use with R410A. Do not use the following tools if they have been used with the conventional refrigerant (R22): gauge manifold, charging hose, refrigerant leak detector, check valve, refrigerant charge spout, vacuum gauge, and refrigerant recovery equipment. R410A does not contain chloride, so leak detectors for use with older types of refrigerants will not detect an R410A leak. Infiltration of the residual refrigerant, refrigerant oil, or water on these tools may cause the refrigerant oil in the new system to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    To reduce the risk of the vacuum pump oil backflowing into the refrigerant cycle and causing the refrigerant oil to deteriorate, use a vacuum pump with a check valve.

    Have a set of tools for exclusive use with R410A. Consult your nearest Mitsubishi Electric Dealer.

    Keep dust, dirt, and water off charging hose and flare tool. Infiltration of dust, dirt, or water into the refrigerant circuit may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    Use refrigerant piping and couplings that meet the applicable standards. For refrigerant pipes, use pipes made of phosphorus deoxidized copper. Keep the inner and outer surfaces of pipes and couplings clean and free of such contaminants as sulfur, oxides, dust, dirt, shaving particles, oil, and moisture. Failure to follow these directions may result in the deterioration of refrigerant oil or compressor damage.

    Store the piping materials indoors, and keep both ends of the pipes sealed until immediately before brazing. Keep elbows and other joints in plastic bags. Infiltration of dust, dirt, or water into the refrigerant circuit may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    Apply ester oil, ether oil, or a small amount of alkyl benzene to flares and flanges. The use and accidental infiltration of mineral oil into the system may cause the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    To reduce the risk of oxidized film from entering the refrigerant pipe and causing the refrigerant oil to deteriorate or damaging the compressor, braze pipes under nitrogen purge.

    Do not use the existing refrigerant piping. A large amount of chloride that is contained in the residual refrigerant and refrigerant oil in the existing piping may cause the refrigerant oil in the new unit to deteriorate or damage the compressor.

    Charge refrigerant in the liquid state. If refrigerant is charged in the gas phase, the composition of the refrigerant in the cylinder will change, compromising the unit's performance.

    Do not use a charging cylinder. The use of a charging cylinder will change the composition of the refrigerant, compromising the unit's performance.

    Charge the system with an appropriate amount of refrigerant in the liquid phase. Refer to the relevant sections in the manuals to calculate the appropriate amount of refrigerant to be charged. Refrigerant overcharge or undercharge may result in performance drop or abnormal stop of operation.

    To reduce the risk of power capacity shortage, always use a dedicated power supply circuit.

    To reduce the risk of both the breaker on the product side and the upstream breaker from tripping and causing problems, split the power supply system or provide protection coordination between the earth leakage breaker and no-fuse breaker.

    Have a backup system, if failure of the unit has a potential for causing significant problems or damages.

    As with R22, the new refrigerant (R410A) is low in toxicity and chemically stable nonflammable refrigerant. However, because the specific gravity of vapor refrigerant is greater than that of air, leaked refrigerant in a closed room will accumulate at the bottom of the room and may cause hypoxia. If exposed to an open flame, refrigerant will generate poisonous gases. Do not perform installation or service work in a confined area.

    ## 2. Refrigerant composition

    R410A is a pseudo-azeotropic HFC blend and can almost be handled the same way as a single refrigerant, such as R22. To be safe, however, draw out the refrigerant from the cylinder in the liquid phase. If the refrigerant in the gaseous phase is drawn out, the composition of the remaining refrigerant will change and become unsuitable for use. If the refrigerant leaks out, it may be replenished. The entire refrigerant does not need to be replaced.

    ## 1. Refrigerating machine oil in the HFC refrigerant system

    HFC type refrigerants use a refrigerating machine oil different from that used in the R22 system. Note that the ester oil used in the system has properties that are different from commercially available ester oil.

    \nExample: Inside the brazed connection\n\nUse of no inert gas during brazing\n\
    \nUse of inert gas during brazing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Items to be strictly\
    \ observed\n\n- \x8C Do not conduct refrigerant piping work outdoors if raining.\n\
    - \x8C Use inert gas during brazing.\n- \x8C Use a brazing material (BCuP-3) that\
    \ requires no flux when brazing between copper pipes or between a copper pipe\
    \ and copper coupling.\n- \x8C If installed refrigerant pipes are not immediately\
    \ connected to the equipment, then braze and seal both ends.\n\n## 2. Reasons\n\
    \n- \x8C The new refrigerating machine oil is 10 times as hygroscopic as the conventional\
    \ oil and is more likely to cause unit failure if water infiltrates into the system.\n\
    - \x8C Flux generally contains chloride. Residual flux in the refrigerant circuit\
    \ will cause sludge to form.\n\n## 3. Notes\n\nDo not use commercially available\

    \n## 1. Items to be strictly observed\n\n\x8C Pressurize the equipment with nitrogen\
    \ up to the design pressure (4.15MPa[601psi]), and then judge the equipment's\
    \ air tightness, taking temperature variations into account.\n\n- \x8C Refrigerant\
    \ R410A must be charged in its liquid state (vs. gaseous state).\n\n## 2. Reasons\n\
    \n\x8C Oxygen, if used for an air tightness test, poses a risk of explosion. (Only\
    \ use nitrogen to check air tightness.) \x8C Refrigerant R410A must be charged\
    \ in its liquid state. If gaseous refrigerant in the cylinder is drawn out first,\
    \ the composition of the remaining refrigerant in the cylinder will change and\
    \ become unsuitable for use.\n\n## 3. Notes\n\nProcure a leak detector that is\
    \ specifically designed to detect an HFC leak. A leak detector for R22 will not\
    \ detect an HFC(R410A) leak.\n\n## 1-3-3 Vacuum Drying\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Photo1)\

    \nTo prevent the vacuum pump oil from flowing into the refrigerant circuit during\
    \ power OFF or power failure, use a vacuum pump with a reverse-flow check valve.\n\
    \n## 2. Standard of vacuum degree (Photo 2)\n\nUse a vacuum pump that attains\
    \ 0.5Torr(65Pa) or lower degree of vacuum after 5 minutes of operation, and connect\
    \ it directly to the vacuum gauge. Use a pump well-maintained with an appropriate\
    \ lubricant. A poorly maintained vacuum pump may not be able to attain the desired\
    \ degree of vacuum.\n\n## 3. Required precision of vacuum gauge\n\nUse a vacuum\
    \ gauge that registers a vacuum degree of 5Torr(650Pa) and measures at intervals\
    \ of 1Torr(130Pa). (A recommended vacuum gauge is shown in Photo2.)\n\nDo not\
    \ use a commonly used gauge manifold because it cannot register a vacuum degree\
    \ of 5Torr(650Pa).\n\n## 4. Evacuation time\n\n\x8C After the degree of vacuum\
    \ has reached 5Torr(650Pa), evacuate for an additional 1 hour. (A thorough vacuum\
    \ drying removes moisture in the pipes.)\n\n- \x8C Verify that the vacuum degree\
    \ has not risen by more than 1Torr(130Pa) 1hour after evacuation. A rise by less\
    \ than 1Torr(130Pa) is acceptable.\n- \x8C If the vacuum is lost by more than\

  - answer: To prevent the reverse flow of vacuum pump oil, either open the relief
      valve on the vacuum pump side or allow air to enter by loosening the charge
      hose before stopping the pump.
    question: What is the recommended action to prevent backflow of oil when a vacuum
      pump is stopped?
  - answer: If a vacuum of 5 Torr or lower cannot be achieved after 3 hours, it suggests
      water intrusion or a leak. The system should be pressurized with nitrogen to
      0.5 kgf/cm²G (0.05 MPa) and then evacuated again. This cycle should be repeated
      until the vacuum is achieved or the pressure stops rising.

    question: During triple evacuation, what is the final vacuum level that the system
      must hold for at least an hour?
  - answer: R410A refrigerant should be drawn from the cylinder in the liquid phase
      to maintain its composition.
    question: When charging R410A refrigerant, in what state should it be drawn from

    - 1) "Maximum total capacity of connectable indoor units" refers to the sum of the numeric values in the indoor unit model names.
    - 2) If the total capacity of the indoor units that are connected to a given outdoor unit exceeds the capacity of the outdoor unit, the indoor units will not be able to perform at the rated capacity when they are operated simultaneously. Select a combination of units so that the total capacity of the connected indoor units is at or below the capacity of the outdoor unit whenever possible.

    ## 2-2 Types and Maximum Allowable Length of Cables

    ## 1. Wiring work

    ## (1) Notes

    - 1) Have all electrical work performed by an authorized electrician according to the local regulations and instructions in this manual.
    - 2) Install external transmission cables at least 5cm [1-31/32"] away from the power supply cable to avoid noise interference. (Do not put the control cable and power supply cable in the same conduit tube.)
    - 3) Provide grounding for the outdoor unit as required.
    - 4) Run the cable from the electric box of the indoor or outdoor unit in such way that the box is accessible for servicing.
    - 5) Do not connect power supply wiring to the terminal block for transmission line. Doing so will damage the electronic components on the terminal block.
    - 6) Use 2-core shielded cables as transmission cables.

    Use a separate 2-core control cable for each refrigerant system. Do not use a single multiple-core cable to connect indoor units that belong to different refrigerant systems. The use of a multiple-core cable may result in signal transmission errors and malfunctions.

  - answer: The valid range of IC addresses for a CITY MULTI indoor unit is 0, or
      01 to 50.
    question: What is the valid range of IC addresses for a CITY MULTI indoor unit?
  - answer: 'The indoor units should be configured in the order: (i) units connected
      to the main BC controller, (ii) units connected to sub BC controller 1, and
      (iii) units connected to sub BC controller 2, with the condition that (i) <
      (ii) < (iii).'
    question: When setting up an R2 system with a sub BC controller, what is the required
      order for configuring the indoor units?
  - answer: The address for a ME remote controller is determined by adding 100 to
      the smallest address of all indoor units within the same group.
    question: What is the method for assigning addresses to ME remote controllers?
  - answer: Addresses should be assigned to LOSSNAY or OA processing units by giving
      each unit an arbitrary but unique address.
    question: After assigning addresses to all indoor units, how should addresses
      be assigned to LOSSNAY or OA processing units?
  - answer: The default address assigned to the main remote controller is 101.

    \nDemand control is performed by using the external signal input to the 1-2 and\
    \ 1-3 pins of CN3D on the outdoor units (OC and OS). Between 2 and 8 steps of\
    \ demand control is possible by setting Dip SW6-8 on the outdoor units (OC and\
    \ OS).\n\n| No   | Demand control switch                | Dip SW6-8   | Dip SW6-8\

    The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are automatically designated as OC and OS.

    They are designated as OC and OS in the descending order of capacity (ascending order of address if the capacities are the same).

    ## 2-7-2 Single Refrigerant System with Two or More LOSSNAY Units

    ## (1) Sample control wiring

    <!-- image -->

    * If the BC address overlaps any of the addresses that are assigned to either the OC, OS, or BS, use a different, unused address. OC, OS, and BS addresses (lowest indoor unit address in the group plus +50) have higher priority than the BS address.

    ## (2) Cautions

    - 1) ME remote controller and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor units.
    - 2) No more than 2 MA remote controllers can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a pair of PAR30MAAU.

    \ are not daisy-chained, connect the transmission line for the central control\
    \ system to TB7 of the OC. (Note a).To maintain the central control even during\
    \ an OC failure or a power failure, connect TB7 on OC and OS together. (If there\

    \ line (TB3) on the outdoor units (OC and OS) (Note a), of the terminal block\
    \ for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB02) on the main and sub BC controllers\
    \ (BC and BS), and of the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line\
    \ (TB5) on each indoor unit (IC). (Non-polarized two-wire)\n\n- \x8C Only use\
    \ shielded cables.\n- a) The outdoor units in the same refrigerant circuit are\
    \ automatically designated as OC and OS in the order of capacity from large to\
    \ small (if two or more units have the same capacity, in the order of address\
    \ from small to large).\n\n## Shielded cable connection\n\nDaisy-chain the ground\
    \ terminal ( ) on the outdoor units (OC and OS), the S terminal of the terminal\
    \ block (TB02) on the BC and BS, and the S terminal of the terminal block (TB5)\
    \ on the indoor unit (IC) with the shield of the shielded cable.\n\n- 2) Transmission\
    \ line for centralized control\n\nDaisy-chain terminals A and B of the system\
    \ controller, M1 and M2 terminals of TB7 (terminal block for centralized control\
    \ system connection) on the outdoor units (OC) in different refrigerant systems,\
    \ and M1 and M2 terminals of TB7 (terminal block for centralized control system\
    \ connection) on the outdoor units (OC and OS ) in the same refrigerant circuit.\
    \ (Note b)\n\nIf a power supply unit is not connected to the transmission line\
    \ for centralized control, replace the power jumper connector on the control board\
    \ from CN41 to CN40 on only one of the outdoor units.\n\nWhen connecting a system\
    \ controller, set the centralized control switch (SW5-1) on the control board\
    \ of all indoor units to \"ON.\"\n\nb) If TB7's on the outdoor units in the same\
    \ refrigerant cir-\n\ncuit are not daisy-chained, connect the transmission line\
    \ for the central control system to TB7 of the OC. (Note a).To maintain the central\
    \ control even during an OC failure or a power failure, connect TB7 on OC and\
    \ OS together. (If there is a problem with the outdoor unit whose power jumper\
    \ was moved from CN41 to CN40, central control is not possible, even if TB7's\
    \ are daisy-chained.)\n\n- c) When connecting TB7, only commence after checking\
    \ that the voltage is below 20 VDC.\n\n\x8C Only use shielded cables.\n\n## Shielded\
    \ cable connection\n\nDaisy-chain the S terminal of the terminal block (TB7) on\
    \ the system controller, OC, and OS with the shield of the shielded cable. Short-circuit\
    \ the earth terminal ( ) and the S terminal on the terminal block (TB7) on the\
    \ outdoor unit whose power jumper connector is mated with CN40.\n\n## 3) MA remote\
    \ controller wiring\n\nSame as 2-7-1\n\n## When 2 remote controllers are connected\
    \ to the system\n\nSame as 2-7-1\n\nSame as 2-7-1\n\n## Group operation of indoor\
    \ units\n\nSame as 2-7-1\n\n## 4) LOSSNAY connection\n\nConnect terminals M1 and\
    \ M2 on the terminal block (TB5) on the indoor unit (IC) to the appropriate terminals\
    \ on the terminal block for indoor-outdoor transmission line (TB5) on LOSSNAY\
    \ (LC). (Non-polarized two-wire)\n\n- \x8C Indoor units must be interlocked with\
    \ the LOSSNAY unit using the system controller. (Refer to the operation manual\
    \ for the system controller for the setting method.) Interlock setting from the\
    \ remote controller is required if the ON/OFF remote controller alone or the LM\
    \ adapter alone is connected.\n- 5) Switch setting\n\nAddress setting is required\

    \ Transmission Line\n\n## (1) Sample control wiring\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (2)\
    \ Cautions\n\n- 1) Be sure to connect a system controller.\n- 2) ME remote controller\
    \ and MA remote controller cannot both be connected to the same group of indoor\
    \ units.\n- 3) Assign to the indoor units connected to the MA remote controller\
    \ addresses that are smaller than those of the indoor units that are connected\
    \ to the ME remote controller.\n- 4) No more than 2 ME remote controllers can\
    \ be connected to a group of indoor units.\n- 5) No more than 2 MA remote controllers\
    \ can be connected to a group of indoor units. It is not possible to connect a\
    \ pair of PAR-30MAAU.\n- 6) Do not connect the terminal blocks (TB5) on the indoor\
    \ units that are connected to different outdoor units with each other.\n- 7) Replace\
    \ the power jumper connector of the control board from CN41 to CN40 on only one\
    \ of the outdoor units.\n- 8) Provide an electrical path to ground for the S terminal\
    \ on the terminal block for centralized control on only one of the outdoor units.\n\
    - 9) When the number of the connected indoor units is as shown in the table below,\
    \ one or more transmission boosters (sold separately) are required.\n- To connect\
    \ two transmission boosters, connect them in parallel. (Observe the maximum number\
    \ of connectable indoor units that are\n\nlisted in the specifications for each\
    \ outdoor unit.)\n\n|                                                        \

  - answer: The fragment does not specify the purpose of the LOSSNAY devices, only
      that they are assigned addresses.
    question: What is the purpose of the LOSSNAY devices?
  - answer: Remote controllers use addresses from 151 to 200.
    question: What address range is used for remote controllers?
  - answer: LOSSNAY units have an address range from 01 to 50.
    question: What is the address range for the LOSSNAY units?
  - answer: The use of a sub BC controller requires the connection of a main BC controller.
    question: What is the relationship between main and sub BC controllers?
  - answer: Addresses are assigned sequentially to outdoor units within the same refrigerant
      circuit, and the address should be equal to the sum of the smallest address
      of the connected indoor units.

    ## 4-1-1 Outdoor Unit Control Box

    ## <HIGH VOLTAGE WARNING>

    <!-- image -->

    - Control box houses high-voltage parts.
    - When opening or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact with any of the internal components.
    - Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes, and check that the the voltage of the electrolytic capacitor (Inverter main circuit) is 20VDC or below. (It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turned off.)

    - 1) Exercise caution not to damage the bottom and the front panel of the control box. Damage to these parts affect the waterproof and dust proof properties of the control box and may result in damage to its internal components.
    - 2) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the cable heads are securely locked in place. Press the tab on the terminals to remove them.
    - 3) Control box houses high temperature parts. Be well careful even after turning off the power source.
    - 4) Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. To plug or unplugconnectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.
    - 5) To connect wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.
    - 6) Reconnect the connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.
    - 7) When opening or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact with any of the internal components. Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes, and confirm that the capacitor voltage (inverter main circuit) has dropped to 20 VDC or less. It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turned off.
    - 8) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.

    - 1) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the cable heads are securely locked in place. Press the tab on the terminals to remove them.
    - 2) When opening or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact with any of the internal components. Before inspecting the inside of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes, and confirm that the capacitor voltage (inverter main circuit) has dropped to 20 VDC or less. It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the power supply is turned off.
    - 3) Control box houses high temperature parts. Be well careful even after turning off the power source.
    - 4) Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. To plug or unplug connectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.
    - 5) To connect wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.
    - 6) Reconnect the connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.
    - 7) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a ground fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.

    - 1) To change the settings, set SW6-10 to ON, set SW4, and press and hold SWP01 for 2 seconds or longer (OFF ↔ ON). LED3 will light up when the switch setting is ON, and lights off when OFF.

    Use the LED3 display to confirm that the settings are properly made.

    - The settings will need to be set again when the control board is replaced. Write down the settings on the electrical wiring drawing label.
    - 2) A: OC: Only the switch on OC needs to be set for the setting to be effective.
    - B: OC: The switches on both the OC and OS need to be set to the same seeing for the setting to be effective.
    - C: OC: The switches on both the OC and OS need to be set.
    - D: OC: The switch on either the OC or OS needs to be set.
    - 3) For details, refer to the following page(s).[5-2-7 Defrost Operation Control](page 127)
    - 4) The table below shows how the target evaporation temperature is set with SW4 (982).

    <!-- image -->

    - 5) Unless otherwise specified, leave the switch to OFF where indicated by "-" or where the cells are blank, which may be set to OFF for a reason.
    - 6) The settings that are configured with SW4 (SW6-10: ON) will automatically be stored on the indoor units that support the new function*. The stored settings will automatically be restored when the outdoor unit control board is replaced.
    - If none of the connected indoor units supports the new function, no configuration information will be saved. If this is the case, manually record the settings configuration on the control box panel.
    - *The new function is supported on most units that are manufactured in December of 2012 and later. Depending on the model, this function may be added on later date. Ask your dealer for further details.
    - 7) The table below shows the combinations of the settings for items No.929 and No.935 and the Heating Capacity mode setting that corresponds to each combination.

      related to the ACCT sensor, IPM, and wiring.
    question: What is the purpose of the short-circuit connector CN6 in the PURY-HP72
      and HP96YKMU-A models?
  - answer: Setting item No.974 to 'OFF' will output error signals and disable the
      base heaters.
    question: What happens if the setting item No.974 is set to 'OFF' on PURY-HP-TKMU-A-H
      series units?
  - answer: Leaving the short-circuit connector on the mating connector during normal
      operation enables error detection and protects the equipment from damage.
    question: What is the consequence of leaving the CN6 short-circuit connector on
      the mating connector during normal operation?
  - answer: The switch SW1-1 enables or disables error detection functions related
      to the ACCT/DCCT sensor, IPM, disconnected CNCT2, and erroneous wiring.
    question: For the PURY-HP72 and HP96TKMU-A-H models, what function does the switch
      SW1-1 control?
  - answer: The switch SW1-1 can be set anytime after power on.
    question: When can the switch SW1-1 be set for PURY-HP72 and HP96TKMU-A-H models?

  - answer: SW1-1 is used to enable or disable no-load operation. When enabled, the
      unit will continue for about 30 seconds before an abnormal stop. It should be
      off during normal operation to keep error detection active.
    question: What is the purpose of switch SW1-1?
  - answer: The address setting for SW1-5 is 0.
    question: What is the address setting for SW1-5 on the control box side before
      power on?
  - answer: The address setting for SW1-5 on the fan-box-side fan inverter board is
      5.
    question: What is the address setting for SW1-5 on the fan-box-side fan inverter
      board?
  - answer: The address should be set before powering on the device.
    question: When should the address be set using SW1-5?
  - answer: Setting SW1-1 to ON during normal operation disables the error detection
      function, which may cause damage to the equipment.
    question: What is the consequence of setting SW1-1 to ON during normal operation?

    Note 2. If both SW1-7 and SW1-8 are set to ON, the fan remains stopped during heating Thermo-OFF. Note 1. Settings in the shaded areas are factory settings.(Refer to the table below for the factory setting of the switches whose factory settings are not indicated by the shaded cells.)

    To prevent incorrect temperature detection due to a build-up of warm air around the indoor unit, use the built-in temperature sensor on the remote controller (SW1-1) instead of the one on the indoor unit inlet thermistor.

    Note 3. By setting SW3-1, SW1-7, and SW1-8 to a certain configuration, the fan can be set to remain stopped during cooling Thermo-OFF. See the table below for details.

    Note 4. The settings that are configured from the remote controller will automatically be stored on the outdoor unit. The stored settings will automatically be restored when the indoor unit control board is replaced.

    The switch setting may vary depending on the indoor unit's type. Refer to relevant Service Handbook for details.

    ## (2) Address switch

    Actual indoor unit address setting varies in different systems. Refer to the installation manual for the outdoor unit for details on how to make the address setting.

    Each address is set with a combination of the settings for the 10's digit and 1's digit. (Example)

    When setting the address to "3", set the 1's digit to 3, and the 10's digit to 0. When setting the address to "25", set the 1's digit to 5, and the 10's digit to 2.

    ## 5-1-3 Remote Controller Switch Functions and Factory Settings

    ## (1) MA remote controller (PAR-20MAU)

    The SW is located at the bottom of the remote controller under the cover. Operate the switches to perform the remote controller main/sub setting or other function settings. Normally, do not change the settings of switches other than the SW1 (main/ sub switching switch). (All the switches are set to "ON" at factory setting.)

  - answer: The defrost cycle will last for at least two minutes once started, unless
      specific temperature and switch settings are reached.
    question: What is the minimum duration of a defrost cycle once it has commenced,
      unless certain conditions are met?
  - answer: ON-defrost operation begins when the outside temperature is between 3.5°C
      and 7.0°C, the compressor has been running for a certain duration (30 minutes
      for single unit, 50 minutes for combination units), and the piping temperature
      meets the specified condition (TH6>TH7 - 8°C for single unit, TH6>TH7 - 10°C
      for combination units), and switch SW4 (848) is ON.
    question: Under what circumstances does the system initiate an ON-defrost operation?
  - answer: If an issue arises during defrost operation, the process will cease, and
      a 20-minute defrost prohibition period based on the cumulative compressor operation
      time will be activated.
    question: What happens to the operation if a malfunction is detected during the

      ends when the pipe temperature reaches 7°C.
    question: What are the temperature thresholds for ending the defrost cycle when
      switch SW4 (916) is set to OFF for the 72 and 96 models?

  - answer: The emergency operation mode allows the system to continue functioning
      when either the OC or OS units experience a malfunction.
    question: What is the primary function of the emergency operation mode?
  - answer: The emergency operation will stop after four hours of compressor operation
      in cooling mode.
    question: If the compressor operates in cooling mode during an emergency, after
      how many hours will the emergency operation cease?
  - answer: To stop the emergency mode and perform a current-carrying operation after
      correcting the error, a power reset must be performed.
    question: What must be done to resume normal operation after an emergency mode
      and correcting the error?
  - answer: The maximum total capacity of indoor units during emergency operation
      is 60%.
    question: What is the maximum percentage of total indoor unit capacity allowed
      during emergency operation?
  - answer: When the OS is in trouble, the emergency operation starts in approximately
      six minutes after a communication error occurs.
    question: In the event of a communication error, how long does it take for the
      emergency operation to initiate when the OS is in trouble?

    Autonomous distributed control system :

    - A system that consists of three independent sub control systems, instead of a single centralized control system, that work together to maintain the overall control of the entire system.

    ## 5-2-17 Refrigerant Circuits and Refrigerant Cycle Diagrams

    <!-- image -->

    ## 5-2-18 Operation Mode

    ## (1) Indoor unit operation mode

    The operation mode can be selected from the following 6 modes using the remote controller.

    |   1 | Cooling mode                    |
    |-----|---------------------------------|
    |   2 | Heating mode                    |
    |   3 | Dry mode                        |
    |   4 | Automatic cooling/heating  mode |
    |   5 | Fan mode                        |
    |   6 | Stopping mode                   |

    ## (2) Outdoor unit operation mode

    |   1 | Cooling only mode   | All indoor units in operation are in cooling mode.   |
    |-----|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
    |   2 | Heating only mode   | All indoor units in operation are in heating mode.   |
    |   3 | Cooling main mode   | Coexistence of units in cooling and heating modes.   |
    |   4 | Heating main mode   | Coexistence of units in cooling and heating modes.   |
    |   5 | Stopping mode       | All indoor units are in fan mode or stopping mode.   |

    When units in cooing and heating coexist, the operation mode (cooling main mode or heating main mode) will be determined, based on the refrigerant pressure in the R2 refrigerant circuit and speed variation data.

    ## (3) Operation pattern for automatic cooling/heating mode

    When the automatic cooling/heating mode is selected from remote controller functions, the indoor temperature will be detected in pattern as shown in the figure below, and the operation mode (cooling or heating) will automatically be selected.

    ## 5-4 Operation Flowcharts

    ## 5-4-1 Operation Sequence Flowchart

    - (1) Indoor unit (cooling, heating, dry, fan mode)

    <!-- image -->

    - *Note 1. Indoor unit LEV fully closed : Opening 41.
    - *Note 2. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit side or the BC controller or outdoor unit side. If some of the indoor units are experiencing a problem, only those indoor units that are experiencing the problem will stop. If the BC controller or the outdoor unit is experiencing a problem, all the connected units will stop.
    - *Note 3. If multiple indoor units are connected to a port and there is a discrepancy in the operation mode between the indoor unit and the port, the operation will be prohibited. (Operation mode blinks on the remote controller, the Fan stops, indoor unit LEV becomes fully closed.)

    ## (2) Outdoor unit (cooling only, heating only, cooling main and heating main modes)

    <!-- image -->

    - *Note 1. For about 3 minutes after power on, search for the indoor unit address, for the remote controller address, and for the group information will start. During this, "HO"/ "PLEASE WAIT" blinks on the display of the remote controller. When the indoor unit to be controlled by the remote controller is missing, "HO"/ "PLEASE WAIT" keeps blinking on the display of the remote controller even after 3 or more minutes after power on.

    *Note 2. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit or the outdoor unit side. The outdoor stops only when all of the connected indoor units are experiencing problems. The operation of even a single indoor unit will keep the outdoor unit running. The error will be indicated on the LED display.

    - *Note 3. The units will follow the operation mode commands from the BC controller
    - *Note 4. When the operation mode commands from the BC controllers are mixed (both cooling and heating), the actual operation mode is determined by the outdoor unit.

    Control

    ## (3) BC controller (cooling only, heating only, cooling main and heating main modes)

    Note 1. The system may go into the error mode on either the indoor unit side or the BC controller or outdoor unit side. If some of the indoor units are experiencing a problem, only those indoor units that are experiencing the problem will stop. If the BC controller or the outdoor unit is experiencing a problem, all the connected units will stop.

    ## 5-4-2 Actions Performed in Different Modes

    ## (1) Cooling operation

    *Note 1. The indoor fan operates at the set notch under cooling mode regardless of the ON/OFF state of the thermostat.

    <!-- image -->

    ## (2) Heating operation

    <!-- image -->

    - 1) When the outdoor unit goes into the defrost mode, defrost command is sent to the BC controller and indoor units. Upon reception of the command, the indoor units will go into the defrost mode. When defrosting is completed and upon receiving the signal that indicates the completion of defrosting, indoor units will resume the heating operation.

    *Note 1.When the indoor unit inlet temperature exceeds 18 C [64 F], the outdoor unit (compressor) and the indoor unit fan start the intermittent operation simultaneously. When the indoor unit inlet temperature becomes 18 C [64 F],or less, the fan always runs (at low speed). The outdoor unit, the indoor unit, and the solenoid valve operate in the same way as they do in the cooling operation when the compressor is turned on.

    \ for refrigerant leak and loose cables and connectors.\n\n## (2) When opening\
    \ or closing the front panel of the control box, do not let it come into contact\
    \ with any of the internal components.\n\n- \x8C Before inspecting the inside\
    \ of the control box, turn off the power, keep the unit off for at least 10 minutes,\
    \ and confirm that the capacitor voltage (inverter main circuit) has dropped to\
    \ 20 VDC or less. (It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after the\
    \ power supply is turned off.)\n- \x8C Control box houses high temperature parts.\
    \ Be well careful even after turning off the power source.\n- \x8C Perform the\
    \ service after disconnecting the outdoor unit fan board connector (CNINV) and\
    \ the inverter board connector (CN1). (To plug or unplugconnectors, check that\
    \ the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor in the\
    \ main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and cause\
    \ an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions. Refer\
    \ to the wiring nameplate for details.)\n- \x8C To connect wiring to TB7, check\
    \ that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.\n- \x8C Reconnect the connector (CNINV)\
    \ back to the fan board and reconnect the connector (CN1) back to the inverter\
    \ board after servicing.\n\n## (3) Measure the insulation resistance between the\
    \ power supply terminal block and the ground with a 500V megger and make sure\
    \ it reads at least 1.0Mohm.\n\n- \x8C Do not operate the unit if the insulation\
    \ resistance is below 1.0Mohm.\n- \x8C Do not apply megger voltage to the terminal\
    \ block for transmission line. Doing so will damage the controller board.\n- \x8C\
    \ The insulation resistance between the power supply terminal block and the ground\
    \ could go down to close to 1Mohm immediately after installation or when the power\
    \ is kept off for an extended period of time because of the accumulation of refrigerant\
    \ in the compressor.\n- \x8C If insulation resistance reads at least 1 M Ω , by\
    \ turning on the main power and keeping it on for at least 12 hours, the refrigerant\
    \ in the compressor will evaporate and the insulation resistance will go up.\n\
    - \x8C Do not measure the insulation resistance of the terminal block for transmission\
    \ line for the unit remote controller.\n\n## (4) When the power is turned on,\
    \ the compressor is energized even while it is not operating.\n\n- \x8C Before\
    \ turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor\
    \ terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor.\n-\
    \ \x8C Check the compressor for a ground fault. If the insulation resistance is\
    \ 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn\
    \ on the power to the outdoor unit. (The liquid refrigerant in the compressor\
    \ will evaporate by energizing the compressor.)\n\n## (5) Make sure the valves\
    \ on both the high-pressure and low-pressure sides are fully open.\n\nSecurely\
    \ tighten the cap.\n\n## (6) Check the phase sequence and the voltage of the power\
    \ supply.\n\nWhen the voltage is out of the ±10% range, or when the phase voltage\
    \ difference is more than 2%, please discuss the countermeasure with the customer.\n\

    ## 6-4 Selecting Remote Controller Functions from an ME Remote Controller

    In the remote controller function selection mode, the settings for three types of functions can be made or changed as necessary.

    - 1) Operation mode display selection mode (Display or non-display of COOL/HEAT during automatic operation mode)

    When the automatic operation mode is selected, the indoor unit will automatically perform a cooling or heating operation based on the room temperature. In this case, AUTO COOL or AUTO HEAT will appear on the remote controller display. This setting can be changed so that only AUTO will appear on the display.

    - 2) Room temperature display selection mode (Display or non-display of room temperature)

    Although the suction temperature is normally displayed on the remote controller, the setting can be changed so that it will not appear on the remote controller.

    - 3) Narrowed preset temperature range mode
    - The default temperature ranges are 67°F to 87°F in the cooling/dry mode and 63°F to 83°F in the heating mode.
    - By changing these ranges (raising the lower limit for the cooling/dry mode and lowering the upper limit for the heating mode), energy can be saved.
    - *The settable range varies depending on the unit to be connected.

    NOTE

    On the PAR-F27MEA-US model, automatic operation mode cannot be selected while the unit is in the narrowed preset temperature range mode. Only the lower limit can be set for cooling/dry mode, and upper limit for heating mode.

    It is important to have a clear understanding of the characteristics of refrigerant\
    \ and the operating characteristics of air conditioners before attempting to adjust\
    \ the refrigerant amount in a given system.\n\n- The following table shows items\
    \ of particular importance.\n- 1) During cooling operation, the amount of refrigerant\
    \ in the accumulator is the smallest when all indoor units are in operation.\n\
    - 2) During heating operation, the amount of refrigerant in the accumulator is\
    \ the largest when all indoor units are in operation.\n- 3) General tendency of\
    \ discharge temperature\n- \x8C Discharge temperature tends to rise when the system\
    \ is short on refrigerant.\n- \x8C Changing the amount of refrigerant in the system\
    \ while there is refrigerant in the accumulator has little effect on the discharge\
    \ temperature.\n- \x8C The higher the pressure, the more likely it is for the\
    \ discharge temperature to rise.\n- \x8C The lower the pressure, the more likely\
    \ it is for the discharge temperature to rise.\n- 4) When the amount of refrigerant\
    \ in the system is adequate, the compressor shell temperature is 10 to 60°C [18\
    \ to 108°F] higher than the low pressure saturation temperature (Te).\n- -> If\
    \ the temperature difference between the compressor shell temperature and low\
    \ pressure saturation temperature (Te) is smaller than 5°C [9°F], an overcharging\
    \ of refrigerant is suspected.\n\n## 6-9 Evaluating and Adjusting Refrigerant\
    \ Charge\n\n## 6-9-1 Refrigerant Overcharge and undercharge\n\nOvercharging or\
    \ undercharging of refrigerant can cause the following symptoms:\n\nBefore attempting\
    \ to adjust the amount of refrigerant in the system, thoroughly check the operating\
    \ conditions of the system. Then, adjust the refrigerant amount by running the\
    \ unit in the refrigerant amount adjust mode.\n\n| The system comes to an abnormal\
    \ stop, displaying 1500 (overcharged refrigerant) on  the controller.        \

    ## 6-9-3 The Amount of Refrigerant to Be Added

    The amount of refrigerant that is shown in the table below is factory-charged to the outdoor units. The amount necessary for extended pipe (field piping) is not included and must be added on site.

    | Outdoor unit model                                             | HP72   | HP96   |
    |----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
    | Amount of pre-charged refrigerant in the outdoor unit (kg)     | 11.8   | 11.8   |
    | Amount of pre-charged refrigerant in the outdoor unit [lbs-oz] | 26-1   | 26-1   |

    ## (1) Calculation formula

    The amount of refrigerant to be added depends on the size and the length of field piping. (unit in m[ft])

    - 1) When the piping length from outdoor unit to the farthest indoor unit is 30.5 m [100 ft] or shorter Amount of added refrigerant (kg) = (0.23 x L$\_{1}$) + (0.16 x L$\_{2}$) + (0.11 x L$\_{3}$)+ (0.2 x L$\_{4}$) + (0.12 x L$\_{5}$) + (0.06 x L$\_{6}$) + (0.024 x L$\_{7}$) + α$\_{1 }$ + α$\_{2}$ + α$\_{3}$ + α$\_{4}$ + β

    Amount of added refrigerant (oz) = (2.48x L$\_{1}$' ) + (1.73 x L$\_{2}$' ) + (1.19x L$\_{3}$' )+ (2.16 x L$\_{4}$' ) + (1.30 x L$\_{5}$' ) + (0.65 x L$\_{6}$' ) + (0.26 x L$\_{7}$' ) + α$\_{1}$ ' + α$\_{2}$ '+ α$\_{3}$ ' + α$\_{4}$ '+ β '

    - 2) When the piping length from outdoor unit to the farthest indoor unit is longer than 30.5 m [100 ft]

    Amount of added refrigerant (kg) = (0.21 x L$\_{1}$) + (0.14 x L$\_{2}$) + (0.1 x L$\_{3}$)+ (0.18 x L$\_{4}$) + (0.11 x L$\_{5}$) + (0.054 x L$\_{6}$) + (0.021 x L$\_{7}$) + α$\_{1 }$ + α$\_{2}$ + α$\_{3}$ + α$\_{4}$ + β

    Amount of added refrigerant (oz) = (2.26x L$\_{1}$' ) + (1.51 x L$\_{2}$' ) + (1.08x L$\_{3}$' )+ (1.94 x L$\_{4}$' ) + (1.19 x L$\_{5}$' ) + (0.59 x L$\_{6}$' ) + (0.23 x L$\_{7}$' ) + α$\_{1}$ ' + α$\_{2}$ '+ α$\_{3}$ ' + α$\_{4}$ '+ β '

    \ on the OS is set to ON.\n\n## Operation\n\nWhen the unit is in the refrigerant\
    \ amount adjust mode, the LEV on the indoor unit does not open as fully as it\
    \ normally does during cooling operation to secure subcooling.\n\n- 1) Adjust\
    \ the refrigerant amount based on the values of TH4, SC11, SC16, and Tc, following\
    \ the flowchart below. The TH4, SC11, SC16, and Tc values can be displayed by\
    \ using the self-diagnosis switch (SW4 (SW6-10: OFF)) on the control board of\
    \ the OC or OS.\n- 2) There may be cases when the refrigerant amount may seem\
    \ adequate for a short while after starting the unit in the refrigerant amount\
    \ adjust mode but turn out to be inadequate later on (when the refrigerant system\
    \ stabilizes).\n\n## When the amount of refrigerant is truly adequate.\n\nSubcool\
    \ (SC11 and SC16) of the BC controller is 5°C [9°F] or above and SH on the indoor\
    \ unit is between 5 and 15°C [9 and 27°F].\n\n## The refrigerant amount may seem\
    \ adequate at the moment, but may turn out to be inadequate later on.\n\nSubcool\
    \ (SC11 and SC16) of the BC controller is 5°C [9°F] or less and SH on the indoor\
    \ unit is 5°C [9°F] or less. Wait until the Subcool (SC11 and SC16) of the BC\
    \ controller reaches 5°C [9°F] or above and the SH of the indoor unit is between\
    \ 5 and 15°C [9 and 27°F] to determine that the refrigerant amount is adequate.\n\
    \n\x8C SC11: Subcool of liquid refrigerant at BC controller inlet; SC16: Subcool\
    \ of liquid refrigerant at BC controller outlet\n\n- 3) High pressure must be\
    \ at least 2.0MPa [290psi] to enable a proper adjustment of refrigerant amount\
    \ to be made.\n- 4) Refrigerant amount adjust mode automatically ends 90 minutes\
    \ after beginning. When this happens, by turning off the SW4 (922) and turning\
    \ them back on, the unit will go back into the refrigerant amount adjust mode.\n\
    \n<!-- image -->\n\n- \x8C For how to read the SW settings, refer to the following\
    \ page(s). [9-1-1 How to Read the LED](page 325)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image\
    \ -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CAUTION\n\nDo not release the extracted refrigerant\
    \ into the air.\n\n## CAUTION\n\nCharge liquid refrigerant (as opposed to gaseous\
    \ refrigerant) into the system.\n\n- \x8C If gaseous refrigerant is charged into\
    \ the system, the composition of the refrigerant in the cylinder will change and\
    \ may result in performance loss.\n\n## 6-10 The Following Symptoms Are Normal\n\

  - answer: The sound is typically due to temporary instability in the flow of refrigerant.
    question: What is the typical cause of a sound emanating from the indoor unit
      right after it starts working?
  - answer: This occurs because the LEVs on some indoor units are slightly open to
      prevent refrigerant from accumulating in the compressor.

    ## 1. Error code definition

    High pressure fault 1 (Outdoor unit)

    ## 2. Error definition and error detection method

    - 1) If the pressure of 3.78MPa [548psi] or higher is detected by the pressure sensor during operation (the first detection), the outdoor stops once, turns to antirestart mode for 3 minutes, and restarts after 3 minutes automatically.
    - 2) If the pressure of 3.78MPa [548psi] or higher is detected by the pressure sensor again (the second detection) within 30 minutes after the first stop of the outdoor unit, the outdoor unit stops once, turns to anti-restart mode for 3 minutes, and restarts after 3 minutes automatically.
    - 3) If the pressure of 3.87MPa [561psi] or higher is detected by the pressure sensor (the third detection) within 30 minutes of the second stop of the outdoor unit, the outdoor unit will make an error stop, and the error code "1302" will be displayed.
    - 4) If the pressure of 3.78MPa [548psi] or higher is detected more than 30 minutes after the stop of the outdoor unit, the detection is regarded as the first detection, and the operation described in step 1 above will start.
    - 5) For 30 minutes after the stop of the outdoor unit, preliminary errors will be displayed on the LED display.
    - 6) The outdoor unit makes an error stop immediately when not only the pressure sensor but also the pressure switch detects 4.15$^{+0,-0.15}$ MPa [601$^{+0,-22}$ psi]

    \ The immersion of sensor tip in water is detected by the ON/OFF signal from the\
    \ float switch.\n- ∗ Submergence of the sensor\n- When it is detected that the\
    \ float switch has been ON for 15 seconds, it is interpreted that the sensor tip\
    \ is immersed in water.\n- ∗ Sensor in the air\n- When it is detected that the\
    \ float switch has been OFF for 15 seconds, it is interpreted that the sensor\
    \ tip is not immersed in water.\n- 2) If it is detected that the float switch\
    \ has been ON for 3 minutes after the immersion of the sensor tip was detected,\
    \ this is considered a drain pump failure, and \"2502\" appears on the monitor.\n\
    - ∗ The total time it takes for this error to be detected is 3 minutes and 15\
    \ seconds, including the time it takes for the first immersion of the sensor tip\
    \ to be detected.\n- 3) Detection of drain pump failure is performed while the\
    \ unit is stopped.\n- 4) The following criteria are met when the criteria for\
    \ the forced stoppage of outdoor unit (system stoppage) are met.\n- ∗ \"Liquid\
    \ pipe temperature - inlet temperature - 10°C [ -18°F] \" has been detected for\
    \ 30 minutes.\n- It is detected by the float switch that the sensor tip has been\
    \ immersed in water for 15 minutes or more.\n- ∗ The conditions that are listed\
    \ under items 1) through 3) above are always met before the criteria for the forced\
    \ stoppage of the outdoor unit.\n- 5) The indoor unit that detected the conditions\
    \ that are listed in item 4) above brings the outdoor unit in the same refrigerant\
    \ circuit to an error stop (compressor operation prohibited), and the outdoor\
    \ unit brings all the indoor units in the same refrigerant circuit that are in\
    \ any mode other than Fan or Stop to an error stop.\n- 6) Forced stoppage of the\
    \ outdoor unit\n- Detection timing: The error is detected whether the unit is\
    \ in operation or stopped.\n- This error is detected whether the unit is in operation\
    \ or stopped.\n- 7) Ending criteria for the forced stoppage of outdoor unit\n\
    - Power reset the indoor unit that was identified as the error source and the\
    \ outdoor unit that is connected to the same refrigerant circuit.\n- Forced stoppage\
    \ of the outdoor unit cannot be cancelled by stopping the unit via the remote\
    \ controller.\n- (Note) Items 1) - 3) and 4) - 7) are detected independently from\
    \ each other.\n\nThe address and attribute that appear on the remote controller\

  - answer: The fundamental problem is a lack of acknowledgement (ACK) signal after
      a transmission.
    question: What is the fundamental problem indicated by error code 6607?
  - answer: The data is transmitted six times before an error is detected.
    question: Following a transmission failure, how many attempts are made to send
      the data before an error is detected?
  - answer: The first suggested step is to turn off the power source of the outdoor
      unit for at least 5 minutes, then turn it on again.
    question: If the error is related to the ME remote controller, what is the first
      suggested step to resolve the issue?
  - answer: The remote controller displays the address or attribute of the controller
      that did not provide the response (ACK).
    question: What does the remote controller display to indicate which controller
      is not responding?
  - answer: If the first step does not work, the wiring of the transmission line for
      the ME remote controller should be checked.
    question: What should be checked if the first troubleshooting step for a system
      controller error does not solve the issue?

  - answer: When 4 or more indoor units are connected to the same port.
    question: What is a condition that requires special attention when connecting
      indoor units to ports?
  - answer: The port with the smaller number should not be connected to the indoor
      unit.
    question: When employing two ports, which port should not be linked to an indoor
      unit?
  - answer: The address of the BC controller (Sub 1 or 2) is not added to the smallest
      indoor unit address connected to the BC controller (Sub1 or 2).
    question: What is the rule regarding the address of the BC controller when using
      two ports?
  - answer: The indoor unit addresses connected to the BC controllers (main, Sub1,
      and Sub2) should not be set in a specific way, as described in the fragment
    question: In a setup with multiple BC controllers, how should the indoor unit
      addresses be configured?

  - answer: The error code 7110 indicates a problem with the transmission or reception
      of connection information signals.
    question: What is the meaning of the error code 7110?
  - answer: An indoor unit is not working because it is not correctly linked to the
      outdoor unit within the same system.
    question: What is the primary reason for an indoor unit being non-operational,
      according to the document?
  - answer: 50 is added to the smallest indoor unit address when setting the address
      of a BC controller (Sub).
    question: When setting the address of a BC controller (Sub), what value is added
      to the smallest indoor unit address?
  - answer: The check is to determine if the model total of indoor units connected
      to the same port is greater than item (1).
    question: In the context of port connections, what is the check if the total of
      the indoor units connected to the same port exceeds the item (1)?

  - answer: The compressor frequency may not rise sufficiently due to a faulty pressure
      sensor, high discharge temperature, high pressure, or excessive pressure drops.
    question: What could be the cause if the compressor's operational speed does not
      increase as expected?
  - answer: Compare the pressure detected by the sensor with the actual pressure using
      the self-diagnosis LED.
    question: What should be done to verify the accuracy of the pressure readings?
  - answer: A lower inlet pressure reading by the low pressure sensor than the actual
      pressure can cause insufficient capacity.
    question: What is the consequence of the low pressure sensor reporting a lower
      value than the actual pressure?
  - answer: Refer to page 180, section 7-3-1, Error Code [1102].

  - answer: One potential cause is a malfunction of the LEV3 actuator, which prevents
      sufficient liquid refrigerant supply to the indoor unit.
    question: What is one potential cause of insufficient heating capacity, despite
      the system initiating correctly?
  - answer: Examine the temperature difference between the upstream and downstream
      sides of the suspected blockage; a significant temperature drop indicates a
      potential clog.
    question: What should be examined to determine if a pipe is blocked by a foreign
      object?
  - answer: The environment where the indoor unit is operating should be changed.
    question: What action should be taken when the indoor unit's air intake temperature
      is below 15°C?
  - answer: A refrigerant leak in the compressor can be detected by checking the discharge
      temperature, which will rise if there is a leak.
    question: How can a refrigerant leak in the compressor be detected?
  - answer: The TH12, TH15, and 63HS1 sensors should be checked, along with their
      wiring.
    question: What sensors should be checked if LEV3 is not operating correctly?

  - answer: The compressor frequency might not increase sufficiently due to a faulty
      pressure sensor, protection mechanisms activated by high discharge temperature
      or high pressure, or an incorrect reading from the low pressure sensor.
    question: What could be the reason if the compressor's operational speed doesn't
      increase sufficiently?
  - answer: The pressure difference between the sensor's reading and the actual pressure
      should be checked using the self-diagnosis LED. If the readings are inaccurate,
      the pressure sensor itself should be inspected.
    question: What should be checked if the pressure sensor is suspected to be faulty?
  - answer: If the high pressure sensor reports a higher pressure than the actual
      pressure, it can cause insufficient capacity.
    question: What is the consequence of the high pressure sensor reporting a higher
      pressure than the actual one?
  - answer: 'The recommended SW4 setting is SW6-10: OFF.'
    question: What is the recommended switch setting (SW) if the condensing temperature
      is higher than the target?

      the opening of the LEV.
    question: What is the consequence of a temperature sensor providing a reading
      higher than the actual temperature on the indoor unit piping?
  - answer: Motor failure, board failure, reduced airflow, pressure drop due to heat
      exchanger blockage, or incorrect temperature detection due to piping issues.
    question: What are the potential causes for an outdoor unit fan's rotational speed
      error?
  - answer: Confirm the capacity drop characteristic due to the piping length and
      change the pipe if needed.
    question: What should be verified when excessively long piping on the high pressure
      side is suspected?

    ## 8-4 Checking Transmission Waveform and for Electrical Noise Interference

    ## 8-4-1 M-NET

- doc_name: a26f32
  offset: 942523
  qa_pairs:
  - answer: The MNET transmission is used for control by exchanging signals between
      the outdoor and indoor units.
    question: What is the primary function of the MNET transmission described in the
      document?
  - answer: The voltage level for a logical '0' should be 2.5V or higher.
    question: According to the document, what is the minimum voltage level that should
      be observed for a logical '0' on the transmission line?
  - answer: The error code 6600 indicates that the signal is misjudged as the signal
      of another address.
    question: What is the error code that indicates a signal is misinterpreted as
      belonging to a different address?
  - answer: Noise interference that prevents normal signal receipt leads to a 'No
      ACK error' with error code 6607.
    question: What is the consequence of noise interference on the transmission line
      that prevents normal receipt of signals, leading to no acknowledgement?
  - answer: Minute noise of approximately 1V can be generated by DC-DC converter or
      the inverter operation; however, such noise is not a problem when the shield
      of the transmission line is grounded.
    question: What is the acceptable level of noise on the transmission signal when
      the shield of the transmission line is grounded?

    Control is performed by exchanging signals between the outdoor unit and the indoor unit (ME remote controller) through MNET transmission. Noise interference on the transmission line will interrupt the normal transmission, leading to erroneous operation.

    ## (1) Symptoms caused by noise interference on the transmission line

    | Cause                                        | Erroneous operation                                                                                                                 | Error code   | Error code definition                     |
    |----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Signal is transformed and will be misjudged as the  signal of another address.                                                      | 6600         | Address overlap                           |
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission wave pattern is transformed due to  the noise creating a new signal                                                    | 6602         | Transmission pro- cessor hardware er- ror |
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission wave pattern is transformed due to  the noise, and will not be received normally leading  to no acknowledgement (ACK). | 6607         | No ACK error                              |
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission cannot be performed due to the fine  noise.                                                                            | 6603         | Transmission line  bus busy error         |
    | Noise interference on  the transmission line | Transmission is successful; however, the acknowl- edgement (ACK) or the response cannot be re- ceived normally due to the noise.    | 6607 6608    | No ACK error No response error            |

    ## (2) Wave shape check

    <!-- image -->

    ## Wave shape check

    Check the wave pattern of the transmission line with an oscilloscope. The following conditions must be met.

    - 1) Small wave pattern (noise) must not exist on the transmission signal. (Minute noise (approximately 1V) can be generated by DC-DC converter or the inverter operation; however, such noise is not a problem when the shield of the transmission line is grounded.)
    - 2) The sectional voltage level of transmission signal should be as follows.

    |   Logic | Voltage level of the transmission line   |
    |---------|------------------------------------------|
    |       0 | V$\_{HL}$ = 2.5V or higher                |
    |       1 | V$\_{BN}$ = 1.3V or below                 |

    ## (3) Check method and remedy

    ## 1) Measures against noise

    Check the followings when noise exists on the wave or the errors described in (1) occur.

    \ Conducts electricity between the oil separator outlet and heat exchanger AND\
    \ the gas ball valve (BV1) and the accumulator to complete the circuit for the\
    \ cooling cycle. When powered: The electricity runs between the oil separator\
    \ and the gas ball valve, and between the heat exchanger and the accumulator.\
    \ This circulation is for heating.\n\nCheck the LED display and the intake and\
    \ the discharge temperature for the 4-way valve to check whether the valve has\
    \ no faults and the electricity runs between where and where.Do not touch the\
    \ pipe when checking the temperature, as the pipe on the oil separator side will\
    \ be hot.\n\nDo not give an impact from outside, as the outer hull will be deformed\
    \ leading to the malfunction of the inner valve.\n\n## (2) In case of SV1a (Bypass\
    \ valve)\n\nThis solenoid valve opens when powered (Relay ON).\n\n- 1) At compressor\
    \ start-up, the SV1a turns on for 4 minutes, and the operation can be checked\
    \ by the self-diagnosis LED display and the closing sound.\n- 2) To check whether\
    \ the valve is open or closed, check the change of the SV1a downstream piping\
    \ temperature while the valve is being powered.Even when the valve is closed,\
    \ high-temperature refrigerant flows inside the capillary next to the valve. (Therefore,\
    \ temperature of the downstream piping will not be low with the valve closed.)\n\

    \ operation, at least one of the solenoid valves among SV4a through 4d turns on.\
    \ Check for proper operation on the LED and by listening for the operation sound\

  - answer: The LEVs are driven by stepping motors, which respond to pulse signals
      from the control boards.
    question: How do the LEVs operate?
  - answer: Upon power-up, a closing signal of 2200 pulses is sent to the LEV to set
      the valve position.
    question: What action is taken when the power is initially supplied to the LEV?
  - answer: When the LEV opening angle does not change, all output phases are turned
      off.
    question: What happens to the output phases when the LEV opening angle remains

  - answer: By placing a screwdriver against the LEV and listening through the handle.
    question: How can one determine if the LEV is making noise?
  text: |
    LEV are stepping-motor-driven valves that operate by receiving the pulse signals from the indoor and outdoor unit control boards.

    ## (1) Outdoor LEV (LEV5a, LEV4), Indoor LEV and BC controller LEV

    The valve opening changes according to the number of pulses.

    - 1) Control boards and the LEV (Indoor unit LEV, and BC controller LEV1 (G type only) and LEV3)

    Outdoor control board

    Note. The connector numbers on the intermediate connector and the connector on the control board differ. Check the color of the lead wire to judge the number.

    <!-- image -->

    - 2) Control boards and the LEV (BC controller LEV1 (Applicable only to the GA and HA types.))

    <!-- image -->

    ## 3) Pulse signal output and valve operation

    | Output  (phase)  number   | Output state   | Output state   | Output state   | Output state   |
    |---------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
    | Output  (phase)  number   | 1              | 2              | 3              | 4              |
    | 1                         |                |                |                | ON OFF OFF ON  |
    | 2                         |                |                |                | ON ON OFF OFF  |
    | 3                         |                |                |                | OFF ON ON OFF  |
    | 4                         |                |                |                | OFF OFF ON ON  |

    Output pulses change in the following orders when the

    Valve is closed; 1 2 3 4 1 Valve is open; 4 3 2 1 4

    - *1. When the LEV opening angle does not change, all the output phases will be off.
    - *2. When the output is open phase or remains ON, the motor cannot run smoothly, and rattles and vibrates.

    ## 4) LEV valve closing and opening operation

    *When the power is turned on, the valve closing signal of 2200 pulses will be output from the indoor board to LEV to fix the valve position. It must be fixed at point A.

    When the valve operates smoothly, no sound from LEV or no vibration occurs, however, when the pulses change from E to A in the chart or the valve is locked, a big sound occurs.

    *Whether a sound is generated or not can be determined by holding a screwdriver against it, then placing your ear against the handle.

  - answer: To check for a leak in the indoor LEV, the target indoor unit should operate
      in fan mode while other indoor units are in cooling mode. Then, the liquid temperature
      (TH22) should be checked using the self-diagnosis LED. A lower temperature than
      expected indicates a potential leak.
    question: What is the procedure to verify if the indoor LEV is not sealing correctly?
  - answer: The first step in removing the coil from the outdoor LEV is to securely
      hold the LEV at the bottom and then turn the coil.
    question: What is the first step in detaching the coil from the outdoor LEV?
  - answer: When removing the coil, the LEV body should be held securely to prevent
      undue force on the pipe.
    question: What should be done to avoid bending the pipe when removing the coil
      from the outdoor LEV?
  - answer: In a cooling-only system, if the pressure sensor is connected incorrectly
      (P1 and P3 reversed), the symptoms are normal operation.
    question: What are the symptoms when the pressure sensor is connected incorrectly
      on the BC controller, specifically when P1 and P3 are reversed, in a cooling-only
      system?

    \n## 8-10-1 Inverter-Related Problems and Solutions\n\n- \x8C Replace only the\
    \ compressor if only the compressor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent will\
    \ flow through the inverter if the compressor is damaged, however, the power supply\
    \ is automatically cut when overcurrent is detected, protecting the inverter from\
    \ damage.)\n- \x8C Replace only the fan motor if only the fan motor is found to\
    \ be defective. (Overcurrent will flow through the inverter if the fan motor is\
    \ damaged, however, the power supply is automatically cut when overcurrrent is\
    \ detected, protecting the inverter from damage.)\n- \x8C Replace the defective\
    \ components if the inverter is found to be defective.\n- \x8C If both the compressor\
    \ and the inverter are found to be defective, replace the defective component(s)\
    \ of both devices.\n\n## (1) Inverter-related problems: Troubleshooting and remedies\n\
    \n- 1) The INV board has a large-capacity electrolytic capacitor, in which residual\
    \ voltage remains even after the main power is turned off, posing a risk of electric\
    \ shock. Before inspecting the inverter-related items, turn off the main power,\
    \ wait for 5 to 10 minutes, and confirm that the voltage at both ends of the electrolytic\
    \ capacitor has dropped to a sufficiently low level.\n- 2) Disconnect the outdoor\
    \ unit fan board connector (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. (To plug\
    \ or unplugconnectors, check that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that\
    \ the voltage of capacitor in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor\
    \ may collect a charge and cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates\
    \ in windy conditions. Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.)\n- 3) To connect\
    \ wiring to TB7, check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.\n- 4) Reconnect the\
    \ connector (CNINV) to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.\n-\
    \ 5) The IPM on the inverter becomes damaged if there are loose screws are connectors.\
    \ If a problem occurs after replacing some of the parts, mixed up wiring is often\
    \ the cause of the problem. Check for proper connection of the wiring, screws,\
    \ connectors, and Faston terminals.\n- 6) To avoid damage to the circuit board,\
    \ do not connect or disconnect the inverter-related connectors with the main power\
    \ turned on.\n- 7) Current sensors become damaged if electricity is passed through\
    \ without them being connected to the circuit board. Connect the current sensor\
    \ to the appropriate connectors on the circuit board before operating the inverter.\n\
    - 8) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the terminals are securely\
    \ locked in place after insertion.\n\n"

  - answer: Apply a thin, even layer of heat radiation grease to the parts, and ensure
      no grease gets on the wiring terminals.
    question: What action should be taken when replacing the IPM, diode stack, or
      IGBT?
  - answer: The insulation resistance should be above 1.0 M Ω.
    question: What is the minimum insulation resistance of the compressor that is
      acceptable before connecting all power supply wires?
  - answer: The breaker capacity should be checked.
    question: What should be checked first if the main power breaker trips?
  - answer: It can damage the compressor.
    question: What could be a consequence of incorrect wiring to the compressor?
  - answer: The earth leakage breaker capacity and the sensitivity current should
      be checked.
    question: What should be verified if the earth leakage breaker trips?

    - 9) When the IPM, diode stack, or IGBT is replaced, apply a thin layer of heat radiation grease that is supplied evenly to these parts. Wipe off any grease that may get on the wiring terminal to avoid terminal contact failure.
    - 10) Faulty wiring to the compressor damages the compressor. Connect the wiring in the correct phase sequence.
    - 11) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. (The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.)

  - answer: If voltage is unbalanced, check section 8-10-6. If there is no problem
      there, change the Fan board. If that doesn't resolve the issue, change the fan
      motor.
    question: What should be done if the voltage imbalance is detected after the RPM
      has stabilized?
  - answer: The branch approach should be greater than 500mm.
    question: What is the required minimum distance for the outdoor unit branch approach?
  - answer: The branch angle should be within ±15° of the horizontal.
    question: What is the acceptable range for the branch angle relative to the horizontal?
  - answer: A zero to several ohm reading, or Meg failure indicates a problem in the
      main inverter circuit.
    question: What could be the cause if a Meg check between the terminals on the
      power terminal block TB1 results in a zero or very low resistance reading?
  - answer: Check the Diode stack, IPM, Rush current protection resistor, Electromagnetic
      relay, and DC reactor. A compressor ground fault should also be considered.
    question: What should be checked if the main power breaker trips after turning
      on the power again, and there is no remote control display?

    ## 8-10-14 Troubleshooting Problems with Intelligent Power Module\n\nMeasure resistances\
    \ between each pair of terminals on the IPM with a tester, and use the results\
    \ for troubleshooting.\n\n- 1) Notes on measurement\n- \x8C Check the polarity\
    \ before measuring. (On the tester, black normally indicates plus.)\n- \x8C Check\
    \ that the resistance is not open ( Ω ) or not shorted (to 0 Ω ).\n- \x8C The\
    \ values are for reference, and the margin of errors is allowed.\n- \x8C The result\
    \ that is more than double or half of the result that is measured at the same\
    \ measurement point is not allowed.\n- 2) Tester restriction\n- \x8C Use the tester\
    \ whose internal electrical power source is 1.5V or greater\n- \x8C Use the dry-battery-powered\
    \ tester.\n\n(The accurate diode-specific resistance cannot be measured with the\
    \ button-battery-powered card tester, as the applied voltage is low.)\n\n- \x8C\
    \ Use a low-range tester if possible. A more accurate resistance can be measured.\n\

    \ Inverter-Related Problems and Solutions\n\n- \x8C Replace only the compressor\
    \ if only the compressor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent will flow through\
    \ the inverter if the compressor is damaged, however, the power supply is automatically\
    \ cut when overcurrent is detected, protecting the inverter from damage.)\n- \x8C\
    \ Replace only the fan motor if only the fan motor is found to be defective. (Overcurrent\
    \ will flow through the inverter if the fan motor is damaged, however, the power\
    \ supply is automatically cut when overcurrrent is detected, protecting the inverter\
    \ from damage.)\n- \x8C Replace the defective components if the inverter is found\
    \ to be defective.\n- \x8C If both the compressor and the inverter are found to\
    \ be defective, replace the defective component(s) of both devices.\n\n## (1)\
    \ Inverter-related problems: Troubleshooting and remedies\n\n- 1) The INV board\
    \ has a large-capacity electrolytic capacitor, in which residual voltage remains\
    \ even after the main power is turned off, posing a risk of electric shock. Turn\
    \ off the unit, leave it turned off for at least 10 minutes, and check that the\
    \ voltage across FT-P and FT-N terminals on the INV board or the terminals at\
    \ both ends of the electrolytic capacitor is 20V or below before checking inside\
    \ the control box.\n- (It takes about 10 minutes to discharge electricity after\
    \ the power supply is turn off.)\n- 2) Disconnect the outdoor unit fan board connector\
    \ (CNINV) before performing maintenance work. (To plug or unplugconnectors, check\
    \ that the outdoor unit fan is not rotating and that the voltage of capacitor\
    \ in the main circuit is 20 VDC or below. The capacitor may collect a charge and\
    \ cause an electric shock when the outdoor unit fan rotates in windy conditions.\
    \ Refer to the wiring nameplate for details.)\n- 3) To connect wiring to TB7,\
    \ check that the voltage is 20 VDC or below.\n- 4) Reconnect the connector (CNINV)\
    \ to the fan board after completion of maintenance work.\n- 5) The IPM on the\
    \ inverter becomes damaged if there are loose screws are connectors. If a problem\
    \ occurs after replacing some of the parts, mixed up wiring is often the cause\
    \ of the problem. Check for proper connection of the wiring, screws, connectors,\
    \ and Faston terminals.\n- 6) To avoid damage to the circuit board, do not connect\
    \ or disconnect the inverter-related connectors with the main power turned on.\n\
    - 7) Faston terminals have a locking function. Make sure the terminals are securely\
    \ locked in place after insertion.\n\nPress the tab on the terminals to remove\
    \ them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 8) When the IPM or IGBT is replaced, apply a thin\
    \ layer of heat radiation grease that is supplied evenly to these parts. Wipe\
    \ off any grease that may get on the wiring terminal to avoid terminal contact\
    \ failure.\n"

  - answer: Connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power
      to the outdoor unit.
    question: What action should be taken if the insulation resistance of the compressor
      is measured to be 1.0 MΩ or less?
  - answer: Refer to the page [8-11-5 Checking the Inverter for Damage during Compressor
      Operation] (page 301).
    question: What should be checked if the compressor is not working, but the inverter
      frequency indicates operation?
  - answer: It can damage the compressor.
    question: What is the consequence of incorrect wiring to the compressor?
  - answer: Disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block and
      measure the insulation resistance of the compressor.
    question: What should be done before energizing the compressor to check for ground
      fault?
  - answer: Refer to the page [8-11-5 Checking the Inverter for Damage during Compressor
      Operation] (page 301).
    question: What should one do if the compressor is making unusual sounds or vibrating
      excessively?
  text: |
    - 9) Faulty wiring to the compressor damages the compressor. Connect the wiring in the correct phase sequence.
    - 10) When the power is turned on, the compressor is energized even while it is not operating. Before turning on the power, disconnect all power supply wires from the compressor terminal block, and measure the insulation resistance of the compressor. Check the compressor for a graound fault. If the insulation resistance is 1.0 M Ω or below, connect all power supply wires to the compressor and turn on the power to the outdoor unit. (The liquid refrigerant in the compressor will evaporate by energizing the compressor.)

      If the error persists after replacing the fan motor, replace the INV board.
      If the fan motor is not locked, refer to the remedies for electrical current
      overload error or sensor error.
    question: What should be done if the unit halts within 10 seconds due to an electrical
      overload or position detection issue, and the error codes 4255 or 5305 with
      detail codes 101 or 132 are displayed?

    question: If a rotational speed error occurs prior to the unit's activation, what
      action should be taken if the error code is 5305 with detail code 134, and the
      error persists after a restart?
  - answer: First, check for strong winds. If windy conditions are not the cause,
      refer to section 8-11-6. If no issues are found in section 8-11-6, replace the
      Fan board. If replacing the Fan board doesn't resolve the issue, replace the
      fan motor.
    question: What should be investigated if an electrical current overload occurs
      during operation, indicated by error code 4255 and detail code 101?
  - answer: Check section 8-11-6 if the voltage is unbalanced.
    question: What is the first step to take when addressing a voltage imbalance of
      5% or 5V after the rotational speed has stabilized?
  - answer: First, check sections 8-11-7 and 8-11-8. If no issues are found, check
      the wiring for a short circuit. If there is no problem with wiring, replace
      the fan motor. If the error persists after replacing the motor, replace the
      Fan board.
    question: What should be checked if a load short circuit is detected, indicated
      by error code 4255 and detail code 105?

    \ plus.)\n- \x8C Check that the resistance is not open ( ∞ Ω ) or not shorted\
    \ (to 0 Ω ).\n- \x8C The values are for reference, and the margin of errors is\

    \ DIP SW 4-1 through 4-10 (Set SW6-10 to OFF.)(Switch number 10 is represented\
    \ by 0), the operating condition of the unit can be monitored on the service monitor.\
    \ (Refer to the table on the following pages for DIP SW settings.) The service\
    \ monitor uses 4-digit 7-segment LED to display numerical values and other types\
    \ of information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\x8C SW4-10 is set to\
    \ \"0\" on the LED Status Indicators Table.\n\n\x8C In the example above, 1 through\
    \ 9 are set to OFF, and 10 is set to ON.\n\nPressure and temperature are examples\
    \ of numerical values, and operating conditions and the on-off status of solenoid\
    \ valve are examples of flag display.\n\n- 1) Display of numerical values\n\n\
    Example: When the pressure data sensor reads 18.8kg/cm$^{2}$ (Item No. 58)\n\n\
    - \x8C The unit of pressure is in kg/cm 2\n- \x8C Use the following conversion\
    \ formula to convert the displayed value into a value in SI unit.\n\nValue in\
    \ SI unit (MPa) = Displayed value (kg/cm$^{2}$) x 0.098\n\n- 2) Flag display\n\
    \nExample: When 21S4a and SV1a are ON. (Item No. 3)\n\nExample: 3-minutes restart\

  - answer: The clock function allows the unit to track the current time using an
      internal timer, based on the time set by a system controller.
    question: What is the primary function of the clock mechanism in the outdoor unit?
  - answer: The date and time are set to "00" by default.
    question: What is the default setting for the date and time on the outdoor unit?
  - answer: When the power is turned off and then on again, the count will resume
      from the time before the power was turned off, which may differ from the actual
      time.
    question: What happens to the time displayed if the indoor unit loses power?
  - answer: The system controller adjusts the time once a day.
    question: How often does a connected system controller adjust the time on the
      outdoor unit?
  - answer: The elapsed time and days since the first power on will be displayed.
    question: What is displayed on the service LED when a time-setting controller
      is not connected?
  text: "## 9-1-3 Clock Memory Function\n\nThe outdoor unit has a simple clock function\
    \ that enables the unit to calculate the current time with an internal timer by\
    \ receiving the time set by the system controller, such as AG-150A.\n\nIf an error\
    \ (including a preliminary error) occurs, the error history data and the error\
    \ detection time are stored into the service memory.\n\nThe error detection time\
    \ stored in the service memory and the current time can be seen on the service\
    \ LED.\n\n- 1) Use the time displayed on the service LED as a reference.\n- 2)\
    \ The date and the time are set to \"00\" by default. If a system controller that\
    \ sets the time, such as AG-150A is not connected, the elapsed time and days since\
    \ the first power on will be displayed.\n- If the time set on a system controller\
    \ is received, the count will start from the set date and the time.\n- 3) The\
    \ time is not updated while the power of the indoor unit is turned off. When the\
    \ power is turned off and then on again, the count will resume from the time before\
    \ the power was turned off. Thus, the time that differs the actual time will be\
    \ displayed. (This also applies when a power failure occurs.)\n- The system controller,\
    \ such as AG-150A, adjusts the time once a day. When the system controller is\
    \ connected, the time will be automatically updated to the correct current time\
    \ after the time set by the system controller is received. (The data stored into\
    \ the memory before the set time is received will not be updated.)\n- (1) Reading\
    \ the time data:\n- 1) Time display\n\nExample: 12 past 9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\
    - * Disappears if the time data is deviated due to a power failure, or if a system\
    \ controller that sets the time is not connected.\n- 2) Date display\n\n\x8C When\
    \ the main controller that can set the time is connected Example: May 10, 2003\n\
