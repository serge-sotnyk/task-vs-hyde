    ## lntroduction

    AII X-Sense combination smoke & carbon monoxide alarms conform with regulatory requirements, including UL 217 & UL 2034 standards and are designed to detect both smoke and carbon monoxide.

    This unit adopts photoelectric technology to detect smoke which is generally more sensitive than ionization technology. lt is effective at detecting large particles, which tend to bе produced in greater amounts bу smoldering fires and may smolder for hours before bursting into flame. Sources of these fires may include cigarettes burning in couches or bedding.

    Carbon monoxide (СО) is odorless, tasteless and invisible - it's а silent killer. Using electrochemical sensing technology, this unit can detect increased levels of carbon monoxide early, protecting your family from the dangers of carbon monoxide.

    Note: For maximum protection, use smoke & СО alarms оп each level and in every bedroom of your home.

    THIS EQUIPMENT SHOULD ВЕ INSTALLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ТНЕ NATIONAL FIRE PROTECТION ASSOCIATION'S STANDARD 72 (National Fire Protection Association, Batterymarch Park, Quincy, МАО2269).

    ## NEVER IGNORE ТНЕ SOUND OF ТНЕ ALARM!

    Determining what type of alarm has sounded is easy with your X-Sense combination smoke & carbon monoxide alarms. The alarm sounder will inform you of the type of situation occurring.

    ## When the Smoke Alarm Sounds:

    Smoke alarms are designed to minimize false alarms. Cigarette smoke will not normally set off the alarm, unless the smoke is Ыown directly into the alarm.

    This unit contains nuisance alarm protection, which will reduce the impact of cooking particles. However, large quantities of combustiЬle particles from spills or broiling could still cause the unit to alarm. Careful location of the unit away from the kitchen area will give the maximum nuisance alarm protection.

    Combustion particles from cooking may set off the alarm if located too close to the cooking area. Large quantities of combustiЫe particles are generated from spills or when broiling. Using the fan on а range hood which vents to the outside (nonrecirculating type) will also help remove these combustiЬle products from the kitchen. lf the alarm sounds, check for nres nrst. lf а nre is discovered, follow these steps. Become thoroughly familiar with these items, and review with all family members!

    *Alert small children in the home. Children sleep very sound and may not bе awakened bу the sound of the smoke alarms.

    *Leave immediately using one of your planned escape routes. Every second counts, so don't stop to get dressed or pick up valuaЫes.

    *Before opening inside doors, look for smoke seeping in around the edges, and feel with the back of your hand. lf the door is hot, use your second exit. lf you feel it's safe, open the door very slowly and bе prepared to close immediately if smoke and heat rush in.

    *lf the escape route requires you to go through smoke, crawl low under the smoke where the air is clearer.

    *Go to your predetermined meeting place. When two people have arrived, one should leave to call 911 from а neighbor's home, and the other should stay to perform а head count.

    *Do not reenter under any circumstance until fire officials give the go-ahead.

    *There are situations where а smoke alarm may not bе effective to protect against fire as noted bу the NFPA and UL Std. 217. For instance:

    - Smoking in bed.
    - Leaving children unsupervised.
    - Cleaning with flammable liquids, such as gasoline.
    - Fires where the victim is intimate with а flaming initiated fire; for example, when а person's clothes catch fire while cooking.
    - Fires where the smoke is prevented from reaching the detector due to а closed door or other obstruction.
    - lncendiary fires where the fire grows so rapidly that an occupant's egress is blocked even with properly located detectors.

    Actuation of your CO Alarm indicates the presence of Carbon Monoxide (CO) which can kill you.

    ## When the Carbon Monoxide Alarm Sounds:

    - 1. Operate the test/reset button.
    - 2. Call your emergency services (Fire Dept. or 911).
    - 3. lmmediately move to fresh air - outdoors or bу an open door/window. Do а head count to check that all persons are accounted for. Do not reenter the premises nor move away from the open door/window until the emergency services responders have arrived, the premises has been aired out, and your alarm remains in its normal

    condition.

    - 4. After following steps 1-3, if your alarm reactivates within а 24-hour period, repeat steps 1-3 and call а qualified appliance technician to investigate for sources of СО from fuel-burning equipment and appliances, and inspect for proper operation of this equipment. lf proЫems are identified during this inspection, have the equipment serviced immediately. Note any combustion equipment not inspected bу the technician and consult the manufacturer's instructions, or contact the manufacturer directly, for more information about СО safety and this equipment. Make sure that motor vehicles are not, and have not been, operating in an attached garage or adjacent to the residence.

  text: |
    The Test & Silence button is used to test the unit's electronics and to silence the unit during an alarm. When testing the alarm weekly, you should first wake up your alarm bу pressing the test button; once the alarm has woken up, the LCD display will activate, then press the test button again until you hear а short bеер, indicating that the alarm has entered the test mode. То save power, the alarm is designed to automatically turn off the LCD display if there has been no operation for 5 minutes.

    Note: After а test has begun, the alarm will sound and the red LED will flash. This does not indicate that smoke/CO is present.

    lf you press the test button during an alarm state, the unit will enter the silence mode.

    СО silence mode: press the test button during an alarm state, the unit will enter the silence mode. lf the СО density still exceeds the alarm threshold within 6 minutes, the unit will enter another alarm state. Otherwise, the unit will exit from silence mode after 9 minutes.

    Note: lf the smoke or СО concentration has reached an alarm level, silence mode cannot bе enaЫed. This unit will continue to alarm until the smoke or СО concentration has decreased to а low level.

    ## Alarm Sounder

    The alarm will sound when there is smoke or СО present, when testing the alarm, and when there is а fault.

    ## LED lndicator

    The LED indicator will flash in conjunction with the alarm sounder. Therefore, it will flash during the following states: when powering on, in standby mode, during smoke or СО alarm states, when exiting an alarm state, during test mode, when there is low battery, in silence mode, when there is а fault and when the unit is at the end of its life.

    ## Low Battery

    The LED indicator will flash yellow together with one bеер every 60 seconds.

    ## ТНЕ UNIT MUST ВЕ DEACTIVATED (see "Deactivation of the Alarm" section) AND REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

    (lf you press the test button when there is low battery, the low battery signal will temporarily cease for 10 hours; if you press the test button again, the unit will enter the test mode and then the standby mode.)

    ## End of Life

    Once the maximum lifetime (10 years) is reached, the alarm delivers 2 beeps and the LED indicator will flash yellow twice every 30 seconds. This end-of-life signal can bе temporarily silenced for 3 days bу pressing the test button.

    The end-of-life silence feature can only bе used for а total of 30 days. After 30 days, the end-of-life signal cannot bе silenced.

    ## What You Need to Know About СО

    СО cannot be seen, smelled or tasted and can be fatal. The build-up of СО in the blооd is called the carboxyhemoglobin (СОНЬ) level and interferes with the body's ability to supply itself with oxygen. Depending on the concentration, СО can kill in minutes. The most common sources of СО are malfunctioning gas appliance used for heating and cooking, vehicles running in an attached garage, blocked chimneys or flues, portable fuel burning heaters, fireplaces, fuel powered tools and operating а grill in an enclosed space.

    lndications of carbon monoxide poisoning include symptoms similar to the flu, but with no fever. Other symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, sleepiness and confusion. Everyone is susceptiЬle to the danger of СО, but experts agree that unborn babies, small children, pregnant women, senior citizens and people with heart or respiratory problems are at the highest risk for serious injury or death. Every year а qualified technician should inspect and clean your heating system, vents, chimney, and flues.

    The following symptoms are related to carbon monoxide poisoning and should be discussed with all members of the household:

    Mild exposure : Slight headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue (often described as "Flulike" symptoms).

    Medium exposure : Severe throbbing headache, drowsiness, fast heart rate.

    Extreme exposure: Unconsciousness, cardiorespiratory failure, death.

    The above levels of exposure relate to healthy adults. Levels differ for those at high risk. Exposure to high levels of carbon monoxide can be fatal or cause permanent damage and disabilities. Many cases of reported carbon monoxide poisoning indicate that while victims are aware they are not well, they become so disoriented they are unable to save themselves by either exiting the building, or calling for assistance. Also, young children and household pets may be the first affected. Familiarization with the effects of each level is important.
